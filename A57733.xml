         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving conceived theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for my own private Uſe, according to my occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inclinations: And (finding ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and benefit by them) I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to Paper, to the intent that by reſort to them, I might again ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in my mind the like ſollace and pleaſure, which accordingly I have done, and enjoyed: Thereupon I communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to ſome of my near Relations, and upon their requeſt to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:34461:5"/>
            <p>Not for any affectation that I have of popularity, for my Genius is quite contrary to that: Nor yet for any fond or overweening opinion of them, or my ſelf in compariſon of others who have writ well and learnedly to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but yet for as much as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to it, and know that they are well intended, and may be uſeful to many: And thoſe that have the Tongue of the Learned may (from the weakneſs (which they ſhall find in theſe) take occaſion to do better) I adventure to come abroad.</p>
            <p>The Subjects upon which they are writ do challenge thy moſt ſtudious intention of mind when thou readeſt of them; thence it is, that I refuſe to be cenſured upon any mans curſory reading (though I know I cannot avoid it) but upon a ſerious weighing and conſidering of the things writ; and I may juſtly crave allowance, for that they were not writ, nor deſigned for the publick.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:34461:5"/>
            <p>If any of the things herein contained ſhall ſeem to be a Treatiſe, rather than Meditations, know the reaſon to be this, that when firſt they were writ, they were divers of them ſhort Meditations, but for methods ſake, the ſame were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put into ſome Order, and ſo took the form of a Treatiſe or Eſſay. Reader, thou mayeſt take theſe labours of mine in good part, becauſe I ſeek nothing by the publication thereof, but to be ſerviceable to God, to my generation, and to thee, who am</p>

               <p>THE Heart is the fountain which ſends forth, and ſtreams it ſelf into words and actions; and by thoſe it is known whether it be good or evil. He that purpoſeth a Regulation of his life and converſation, muſt begin with this as the firſt mover; preſerve and watch this with moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent care, that there come no evil into it, whereby it be diſordered, and ſo the whole ſtream be defiled and fouled <hi>(ſincerum eſt niſi vas quodcunque infundis acceſſit,) Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Keep
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34461:7"/>thy heart with all diligence, Ne cures ea quae ſtultè miraris. Horat.</hi> Think not on that which may tempt thee. It may be compared to a Ship un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſale, whoſe Pilot muſt ever be watchful to look to his ſteerage, leſt he ſplit upon Rocks, or be ſwallowed up with Sands. This Pilot is Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Guided and Illuminated not by any Star, <hi>Cynoſura, Helice,</hi> nor other, but from a higher Orb, the Spirit of God, which exerting it ſelf in our actions and converſations, is called Grace, for the Love of God, Humility, Patience, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Chaſtity, and the reſt, as they are called the fruits of the Spirit, are graces and beams of this light; ſo looking to their original, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Spirit of Love, Joy, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is that which the true Light in the internal Horizon, and the Fire wherewith Jeſus Chriſt baptizeth the Regenerate, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.16. Reaſon then in the ſoul of man muſt alwaies keep it ſelf in action, leſt the affections wanting their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour at the ſtern, precipitate the ſoul, upon <hi>Sylla</hi> on one ſide, or <hi>Caribdys</hi> on the other; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extreme of exceſs, or of defect; or elſe muſt ſteer a contrary courſe.</p>
               <p>But if by continual Meditation on good things, it ſets before it ſelf alwaies the place for which it is bound, and the end of its creation; and hath an eye to that luminary by which it guides its courſe, and keeps on its courſe with a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual motion, by every wind and gale without digreſſions by theſe means, it may ſale ſafely, and may expect a ſafe and happy voyage; and bleſſed be God there is no curtain drawn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the light, as was to them under the Law.</p>

               <p>What little pleaſure, delight or ſatisfaction doth he take in his buſineſs, that never thinks of it but when he is doing it? or prepares not for it? Certainly that work is but a burthen to him, and is performed of neceſſity only, not freely and cheerfully, of love or liking; but God will have his ſervants to delight in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thy ſelf in the Lord. I ſate under his ſhadow with delight.</hi> God loveth a chearful giver. And the Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to him; how much more when he giveth it with an evil mind? Whatever we do unto him, we muſt do it heartily. <hi>I delight to do thy will O God, yea thy Law is my hope, Pſ.</hi> 1.2. His delight is in the Law of the Lord. What Art or Science can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? what proficience can be made in any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſtudy without meditating and ruminating, weighing and conſidering, diſcuſſing and digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mind every thing and term of Art? So he that doth deſire to be a proficient in the School of Chriſt as a good Diſciple, muſt attain it by ſtudy, and muſt conſider, weigh, examine and compare ſpiritual things with ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>For example therefore conſider, that great proficient that obtained ſo great and honourable an Epethite, as to be called, The man after God's own heart: how often doth he inculcate this very thing upon himſelf and others in the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> from the beginning to the end?

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34461:8"/>man thus, <hi>His delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in his Law will he exerciſe himſelf day and night.</hi> And this he avers of his own practice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>Have I not meditated of thee on my bed? and thought upon thee when I was waking?</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>O how I love thy Law!</hi> All the day long is my ſtudy therein! Sometimes his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is of God's works, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>I will conſider the Heavens, the works of thy hands.</hi> And he affirms, That he will meditate of all his wondrous works. And ſometime he is medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Precepts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. And gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſo doing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. All his delight is therein. They are the joy of his heart; ſweeter to him than the Honey, or the Honey-comb. He had choſen them, and loved them exceedingly. And he eſteemed them above all manner of Riches; above all treaſure of gold or precious ſtones, and above his neceſſary food. Having ſo great a value of them, and knowing the worth of them, it muſt follow that he loved them with delight, and that brings the other, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent thinking of them; and that brings the heart to a holy frame and diſpoſition, and keeps it ſo. This is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> preſſeth, <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, And above all things keep thy heart.</hi> For if we do pray for a clean heart, <hi>Create in me a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi> Yet, original corruption of nature, drawn from the loins of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is ſuch, that like a running ſore, though it be wiped clean, yet ſtill ſends forth putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, therefore hath continual need of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual medicaments to heal it, and keep it in health, and ſuppreſs and purge away peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34461:8"/>which medicaments, the Spirit by the word operates in thoſe who ſeek them. If then our nature is corrupted and degenerate, and abominably wicked, and is prone to follow cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principles, and hardly reſtrained from them, as every mans experience tells him. Let him that hath taſted the heavenly gift, and the power of the world to come, if he like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the reliſh of it, let him ruminate upon it, keep it under his tongue, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of the wicked, of their delight in ſin. If like water that is heated, which ſoon will become cold again, our affections to heavenly things ſoon grown dull and decay, we muſt bring them again to that fire which firſt warmed them; or (if we can) not to let this fire go out, as the fire upon the Altar did not. For in all duties of Religion, perſeverance is enjoyn'd, and upon this very ground as that duty of prayer. <hi>Continuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in prayer,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Rejoyce evermore, pray without ceaſing, Matth. Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation.</hi> This aſſiduity doth not only ſhut the door againſt vain and evil thoughts, motions and imaginations, luſts and temptations; but alſo keeps in the good and virtuous reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and radicates them. <hi>Therefore ſeek the Lord while he may be found; ſeek his face ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> if thou have found him. How little trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure have I in Heaven, if my heart be not there often by holy meditation? but if I am aſſured of my intereſt there, I ſhall ſollace my ſelf with that in all conditions; as the Athenian in <hi>Horace</hi> ſollaced himſelf with his cheſts full of money, which he contemplated: ſo heavenly ſouls, for whom thoſe heavenly manſions are prepared,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34461:9"/>and the Crown of Life that never fadeth; they keep their hearts from ſinking, and ſollace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their diſtreſſes, by the hope that they have of their eternal ſalvation: This allays the bitterneſs of their affliction; and ſo great it is, and wonderful, that the heart of man cannot conceive it. But if we have an intereſt in them, yet if we do not meditate of it, what are we the better for it? therefore with <hi>Moſes</hi> have an eye to the recompence of reward: And this makes it out that we have choſen God for our portion.</p>
               <p>As love is the principle of all Religion and Duty, which gives the life and heat to them, without which they are but mercenary, dull and formal, without power; becauſe faith doth work by love. The Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. is ſick of love. All the reciprocal ſociety of the Spouſe and her Beloved, is Love. So this practice of holy Meditation proceeds from Love, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>O how love I thy Law! all the day long do I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate therein, Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>Have I not meditated of thee on my bed?</hi> &amp;c. Conſequently the meditation of, and of upon our beloved object, is our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enjoyment and happineſs if our affections be rightly placed; this proves that the ſpeculative life is moſt pleaſant.</p>
               <p>All our graces are kept alive; all our virtues ſtrengthened; all our good reſolutions put in execution by this means. And by the want and neglect of this they all ſlip out of our minds, are weakned, decay and dye, and the contrary invade us; as we read in 1 <hi>chap.</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> of thoſe that God had given up to all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they liked not to retain God in their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34461:9"/>thoughts or knowledge; therefore God gave them up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. They regard not in their minds the works of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore we often find illiterate perſons who can diſcourſe of moſt points of Religion, better, more knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſoundly, and more readily, than the learned, which comes to paſs meerly by the help of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, which theſe practice, and the others neglect. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 92.5. meditating of the wonderous works of God, and his thoughts which are to us-ward, calls him unwiſe who doth not conſider it, and him that doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, a fool. But he that is wiſe (he ſaith) he will ponder them, and ſhall underſtand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> intimating, that without ſuch pondering, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand his principal concerns: How then can the Law of God convert a ſoul if it be not meditated of by that ſoul? or how can the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of God make wiſe the ſimple, if they be not ſtudied and learned? How can they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the heart, and comfort us in trouble, and afford us hope, unleſs the heart rejoyce in the meditation of them? How could they be a light to our feet, and lanthorn to our paths? How can we be guided by them, unleſs we thus keep them in our minds? They can have no deſire after the ſincere milk of the word, who have not taſted it by holy meditation, nor can they grow thereby unleſs they thus feed upon it. How can the good ſeed of God's word take root in our hearts, and bring forth fruit in our lives, if the cares of this world, or deceitfulneſs of Riches hinder us from conſidering and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating upon it, ſo as to faſten it in our hearts, and fix it upon our underſtandings and affections?
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34461:10"/>He that deſires to draw near to God, or to walk with him, muſt do this duty. He that deſires to be taught of God, and hear the voice behind him, ſaying, this is the way, he muſt be converſant in this. He that doth not this, muſt either be a luke-warm Chriſtian, or an Hypocrite, or no Chriſtian; for an Hypocrite may diſcourſe and talk of the things of Religion, Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Renovation and Regeneration, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Converſion; of forſaking the world, and taking off his affections from the things below, and ſetting them on things above; but he doth little think of thoſe things which be powerful to take off his affections from the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eyes, and the pride of life: and to fix them on God, and on the beauty of holineſs; but the Regenerate man that finds corruption in his heart, will be reſtleſs in his thoughts, when he finds ſome corruption ready to break out, and lead him captive to ſin, until he hath found out ſome thing in the word of God that hath efficacy, and power by his endeavour, and the Aſſiſtance of God's Grace, to conquer every thought, inclination and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of his corrupt nature. As if peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a ſlanderous tongue hath provoked him with ſuch ſlanders as he moſt abhors; and he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf too prone to return the like, <hi>viz.</hi> Railing, for Railing, Curſing for Curſing. He thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on retires himſelf, and either by his own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory calls to mind the behaviour of the Saints of God, and the holy commands of him that hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvelous light, out of ſin, to ſanctification and holineſs; (And what he commands us to do, that he hath
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34461:10"/>called us to) not to ſerve ſin, or live any longer therein, but that we ſhould walk as Chriſt walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as he was Reviled, and Reviled not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but ſubmitted to him that judgeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; ſo he endeavours alſo, and praies to God that he may conform himſelf, or elſe he betakes himſelf (for the help of his memory) to the written word, and will ſearch what holy <hi>Job</hi> did in the like caſe, being falſly accuſed by his Friends; and there finding that the Holy man anſwered thoſe falſe accuſations thus, <hi>My wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in Heaven, my Record is on high.</hi> This directs him, and inables him to conquer his paſſion, and he rejoiceth that he hath found ſuch a powerful Scripture, and he endeavours to improve it by meditation, that he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alwaies to make uſe of it upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. And God ſo much bleſſeth his people, and directs and guides them in this buſineſs, that he often helps them, when at a loſs, and directs them by accident, to hear ſuch a Sermon, or read ſuch a place as moſt properly agrees with their meditation, and preſent occaſion, whereby they receive ſatisfaction, and will never leave the meditation of it, till they conceive them ſelves able to conquer the like temptation. So if they be encountered with the love of the world, and find themſelves hardly beſet with the bate of covetouſneſs, or with the luſts of the fleſh, they intend with all their might, thoſe arguments which are prevalent with the Saints of God to take them off this ſenſual love to the heavenly love; to love God and his Grace, and ſpiritual gifts and injoyments, and Jeſus Chriſt our bleſſed Saviour, and Redeemer, who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34461:11"/>ſhed his precious blood for us, and in deeds and words of the higheſt expreſſions, hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his love to us, courting us to love him again with ſuch ſignificant, and full expreſſions of his love, as no tongue could ever expreſs, unleſs they uſe his very expreſſions, which he uſeth in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> to endear thee; wherein he both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth the commendation of the ſeveral parts of the body of his Beloved, and of the whole, ſaith, <hi>Thou art all fair my Love.</hi> And he alſo promiſeth to give her his loves. Who ſo ſhall diligently conſider of theſe, he will eaſily break out into that expreſſion of his love to Chriſt, which the Spouſe maketh, <hi>viz. Thy Love is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Wine,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>The King hath brought me into his Chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in thee; and will find great ſatisfaction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the name of him, as in a ſweet perfume. Thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore the Virgins Love thee.</hi> And with the Spouſe, cannot but ſeek him, though ſhe ſuffer injuries from rude perſons, when ſhe enquires after him, ſtill ſhe perſiſts, Tell me where thou feeds; for the inlightned, converted ſoul knoweth that it muſt not love the world, neither the pleaſures nor profits; and if it doth, the love of the Father is not in it, nor the love of Jeſus Chriſt; for this love expels all other; he that drinks of this water thirſts no more. And when the heavenly Spouſe hath ſought her Beloved, and beſought him for the kiſſes of his mouth, and is enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his beauty, and is ſatisfied with his beauty only, and remembers his loves more than wine, and delights to hear his name, and is ſick of love, he will not fail then to bring her into his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-houſe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34461:11"/>and defend her with his love, as with a banner, and ſtay her with flaggons, and comfort her with Apples; and alſo he will bring her into his chambers, and unvail his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to her, and give her his loves: And now ſhe may well deſpiſe all other Rivals of her love; like the Eagle that catcheth not Flies; or like him who hath drunk the ſweet waters of the fountain, he will not preſently drink in a muddy puddle, or ſeek to quench his thirſt in broken Ciſterns which hold no water.</p>
               <p>And ſo for other temptations, and perils which the ſoul findeth it ſelf to lye under through the temptations and ſnares of its ſpiritual enemy, and its own frailty and inbred corruptions; ſhe beſtirreth her ſelf till ſhe hath gotten ſtrength to vanquiſh her ſpiritual enemy; which having obtained, ſhe rejoyceth with joy unſpeakable, and glorious in Chriſt, and is ſatisfied, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth her ſelf more than in the things of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit, or any other worldly enjoyment; and ſings praiſes to God for giving ſuch ſtrength and aſſiſtance whereby it is able to overcome.</p>
               <p>All which matters are the meditations of the gracious ſoul, which ſeeks Gods face evermore.</p>
               <p>And theſe be the means by which it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to be prepared for every good work. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the gracious ſoul hath in a great meaſure conquered the corruptions of nature, and is ſure of its ſalvation, and God doth ſay to it, I am thy ſalvation, yet is ſhe not ſatisfied, quiet, at reſt, or contented, unleſs ſhe enjoy her Beloved in a cloſe communion, ſollacing her ſelf with him in reading his word, praying, and meditating of him, and praiſing him. The Spouſe knew her
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34461:12"/>Beloved was hers, and ſhe his, but was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, unleſs ſhe might lay him all night as a bundle of myrrh between her breaſts. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his perſon, the kiſſes of his mouth, and his favours and new pledges of his love, is that which ſatisfieth her: The Flaggons and the Apples are the things which ſtay her, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, and ſhe muſt and will have them, and will not be ſatisfied without them, becauſe ſhe is ſick of love, (and as Lovers uſe to do) ſo ſhe muſeth and meditates in the night of the favours ſhe hath received; and alſo deſigns and contrives which way to obtain them again, becauſe ſhe remembers them more than wine; for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed her more, and were more ſweet to her taſte, and for deſire of theſe, ſhe is often me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, though ſhe be ſure of her intereſt in him; that her Beloved is hers, as ſhe was when ſhe run ſeeking him about the City; for his coming to her door at ſuch an hour of the night, and his ſollicitations and addreſſes to be let in, and the difficulties which he went through to come to her, though the weather favoured not; all ſhewed her love; but this enflamed her love the more, ſo that ſhe would not be ſatisfied without the enjoyment of his perſon, and all other favours that Lovers have to beſtow and can deſire. She muſt ſit under his ſhadow with delight, and eat that fruit of his which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to her taſte, and be brought into his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting houſe, and repoſe her ſelf in his arms; becauſe ſhe admires him in all things, and in all his parts ſhe ſees ſuch raviſhing perfection, that ſhe will not enjoy her ſelf at all, unleſs ſhe may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34461:12"/>ſee his countenance, hear his voice, or embrace him in her arms, and in her boſom, in which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments ſhe is fully taken up, as well waking as ſleeping; for though ſhe ſleep, her heart waketh: This fire never goeth out, but is alwaies burning upon her heart, as that upon the Altar was, which was the type of this; and ſo muſt it alſo be with thoſe who profeſs to be, and are his ſervants, and peculiar people. And they ſhall alſo be endeared to Chriſt their Beloved; and he will ſee all lovelineſs in them as his Spouſe, his Garden incloſed, his Siſter, his Beloved; his Friend; he will delight frequently to come into into his Garden and gather his pleaſant fruits, flowers, and ſpices; drink of the wine of the Pomegranate preſſed, eat his honey-comb with his honey; and he will be found of his Beloved in the duties of reading, meditation, prayer, and the holy Supper, which is his banquet, which he giveth her; But ſhe gets many a kiſs from him in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer and meditation: And when ſhe hath found him, ſhe will not let him go; ſhe holds him faſt in her arms, and hangs about him: But if ſhe is but in purſuit of him, her heart is warmed with his love, by ſuch impreſſions as ſhe will not looſe till ſhe enjoy him.</p>
               <p>All which enjoyments of the heavenly ſoul are the operations of the holy Spirit, and the graces of God working in the heart, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in Heaven, by heavenly meditation of the things of God, and keeping in thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations which otherwiſe the world would juſtle out, if ſhe ſhould not be as a garden encloſed, as a fountain ſealed, that is (as if he ſhould ſay) ſpringing waters that admit nothing to pollute
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34461:13"/>or defile them, or to diſturb or muddy them. And the incloſure of this garden ſignifieth, that fence of watchfulneſs in this duty whereby thoſe things are kept out, which would crop off thoſe pleaſant plants, and rich ſpices there growing, for the uſe, ſervice and delight of her Beloved, and are for him preſerved, guarded and ſecured.</p>
               <p>This duty is often enjoyned as a moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary part of Divine Worſhip, and preſſed with very large promiſes; and by the experience of all the Saints of God found to be the moſt avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means for the avoiding of that ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and for getting and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of every grace. For reading God's word, without thus retaining God in their thoughts, is little available; no more is prayer; for we find there be many who have frequently both read and heard it, who ſtill remain uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from the errours of their waies, and do neither live upon it, or by it, nor endeavour to come up to it; nor to be changed from what they are by nature, nor retain it in the love of it.</p>
               <p>So we ſee that there are many that faſt, and pray, and preach too, and yet are not cleanſed from ſin; however they are pure in their own ſight, and ſay, <hi>Stand off, for I am holier than thou.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore the wiſe man exhorts to be ſwifter to hear, rather than to offer the ſacrifice of fools: And a type of this was that ceremonial Law, that thoſe beaſts that did not chew the cud ſhould be unclean, and not to be ſacrificed. And for want of this, the word preached to men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſlips out of their minds: their worldly affairs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34461:13"/>that take up their thoughts, give them no time to faſten the word in their hearts, ſo as to take root, and bring forth fruit: but like the ſeed ſowed on ſtony ground, or thorny ground, or that falls by the way, it comes to no perfection. Hence it is that the Lord commanded the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Joſ.</hi> 1.8. Let not this Book of the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all that is written therein; for then thou ſhalt make thy way proſperous, and then thou ſhalt have good ſucceſs. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4.8, and 9. ſaith, <hi>Think on theſe things which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and ſeen in me, and the God of peace ſhall be with you, Pſal.</hi> 107.17. The loving kindneſs of the Lord endureth for ever to them which think upon his commandments to do them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.3. <hi>With joy ſhall ye draw water out of the wells of ſalvation:</hi> Which promiſe (I conceive) extends to all duties of Religion, and ſo to this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among the reſt: But (ſure I am) that without this a man cannot be well diſpoſed, nor well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any other with comfort: the more we make uſe of this, the more joy we have in us: and this is to be alwaies performed, others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Commune with your own hearts, and in your Chamber be ſtill.</hi> What comfort and ſatisfaction doth it yield to the virtuous mind, to contrive and meditate how to do well, holily, and according to vertue, the very Idea of the action hath beauty, and delight, though perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture we are not able ſometimes to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording, becauſe of our infirmities; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the evil mind delighteth in evil, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.15.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34461:14"/>And this delight in good, and the impreſſion of the beautifulneſs and decency of the action, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites to the Act. Although evil be preſent with us when we endeavour our ſelves to do the thing by reaſon of our corrupt nature, and our Ghoſtly enemy.</p>
               <p>If this were not a clear truth, it might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently demonſtrated by its contrary. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance or remembrance of any unſeemly or impious action, how full of loathing and horror is it? or if they be but vain thoughts that lodge in us, as they muſt needs do in thoſe who read ludicrous, vain and ſcurrilous books, or ſpend their time in the Theatre, the mind and manners will be formed accordingly, unleſs we diſguſt them. I mean not that the ſins of God's people are often premeditated; for if they did preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate them, I ſuppoſe they would avoid them; but yet ſometimes they do conſider of ſin, but moſt commonly break off their conſideration, and purpoſe with loathing of it, and themſelves too, for their thoughts and aſſayes of ſinning; but thoſe ſins which they committed before their converſion, they remember after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, with the contrivance of them, with loathing; and the ſins which they ſee others contrive, or read, or hear of: And often the wickedeſt perſons that are, when they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their fouleſt ſins, they abhor them, and tremble, and endeavour to put out of their minds the remembrance of them, for the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible foulneſs which they then perceive in them, and for the offence which they yield them.</p>
               <p>This Duty then being enjoyned us by God as moſt neceſſary and powerful for attaining and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34461:14"/>improving of every grace, and for the avoiding of all, and every ſin and temptation, that our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is inclined to, or liable to be drawn to. Let theſe reaſons be ſufficient to convince us of the neceſſity and utility of it, and the delightfulneſs of it, both to God and our ſelves, and put us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the practice of it, that we may be Royal Prieſts to God, and our bodies may be the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, and our hearts God's holy Altars, upon which the fire ſhall ever burn, and Incenſe without ceaſing, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> 73.

               <p>Holy Meditation is the thing whereby we edifie our ſelves; and holy life and converſation is that whereby we edifie one another in the moſt holy Faith.</p>

               <p>THAT God is, and that he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped, is written in the heart of man with indelible characters; for it appears, that before any Law was given, the Light of Nature did not only inſtruct men of the Being of God, and of the neceſſity of Divine Worſhip; but alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them ſuch plentiful inſtruction of the manner of the Worſhip too, that he that had an honeſt ſincere heart, might and did perform it in an acceptable manner; as <hi>Abel</hi> did without any other Inſtructer.

               <p>And if there be any individual perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who do, or doth deny God, or his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the ſame have nothing of the Image of God left in them; nor any thing of the holy Spirit of God in them. That wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which they have in them, thus corrupted, is the Image of the Devil, or the Image of the brute beaſts; as St. <hi>James</hi> calls their wiſdom, carnal ſenſual, and deviliſh: And what they know naturally as brute beaſts, in thoſe things they corrupt themſelves; as St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks: Their chief ſtudy, care, labour and induſtry; all their deſigns, providence, and all their wiſdom, is to ſatisfie their ſenſual appetites, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for back, and belly; therefore the Apoſtle ſaith of them, their <hi>God is their belly,</hi> and they <hi>mind earthly things.</hi> This wiſdom doth expel and extinguiſh the wiſdom which is from above. So that they become Atheiſtick.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 <hi>ep. cap.</hi> 3. Hath prophecied that ſuch ſcoffers ſhall come in theſe laſt daies, &amp; he ſaith that they are willingly ignorant. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance makes them fearleſs, ſhamleſs and hopeleſs.</p>
               <p>That theſe Atheiſtick principles are not from our Nature, nor born with us, but the contrary, are from the light of Nature, and by our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of our ſelves we become Atheiſts, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proved by this.</p>
               <p>That to us who live under the preaching of the goſpel, and have liberty to read it our ſelves, the glorious light thereof would ſhine into our hearts, if we did not like, love, cheriſh, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that corruption of Nature which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our bleſſed Saviour hath told us this truth,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34461:16"/>
                  <hi>Light is come into the world, but this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that men love darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their works are evil.</hi> If they affect Darkneſs, they will improve it, and the more evil their works are, ſo much the more will they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their darkneſs, and endeavour to extinguiſh their light hate it, and fly from it, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them. And they deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Moſt High, becauſe it makes againſt them, and their deſigns, and againſt their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and deſperateneſs.</p>
               <p>Beſides which the Apoſtle ſheweth another cauſe whereby this blindneſs is contracted, <hi>viz. The God of this world hath blinded their eyes.</hi> If they have choſen the God of this world to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſerve him, they muſt needs pull out their weak eyes, which nature corrupted had contracted, or ſuffer him to put them out. Such terms as <hi>Nahaſh</hi> would have impoſed upon the men of <hi>Jabeſh Giliad,</hi> 1 Sam. 11.</p>
               <p>From theſe two cauſes it proceeds, that men who profeſs themſelves wiſe, and have excellent parts, yet knowing him to be God, they love him not, nor like they to worſhip him, nor to retain him in their thoughts, but become vain in their thoughts and imaginations, and harden their fooliſh heart. The Lord will not by his Spirit alwaies ſtrive with them, but gives them up to their affected blindneſs, and to ſerve ſuch gods as they have choſen: Their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and their luſts: And he takes away his holy Spirit from them, and that talent which he had given them: And yet the gifts and graces of God are without repentance, for they are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not God. For ſeeing that neither the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34461:16"/>word of God, which is the power and wiſdom of God contained in the Goſpel of our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour will convince them: Nor yet his great and mighty works of the Creation of the world, and the preſervation thereof. The hanging of the Earth upon nothing, and the other wonderful works of God mentioned in the 25th. of <hi>Joh,</hi> nor the uſefulneſs &amp; convenientneſs of the ſeaſons of the year, and the benefits which they themſelves reap thereby, is not by them conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. Nor yet God's extraordinary providences, when their mighty preparations of forces and Armies are defeated by ſilly and weak means, as thoſe of the <hi>Moabites</hi> were by <hi>Gideon:</hi> Or when they are ſubdued and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown as it were by the Heavens, as the Poet <hi>Claudian</hi> expreſſed it, <hi>&amp; conjurati veniunt in claſſica venti;</hi> yet they will not ſee God's hand, but ſay, <hi>Though the bricks are fallen down, we will build with hewn ſtone.</hi> Nay, though the Lord doth deſtroy them by his Angels, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. the Angel deſtroyed 185000. of <hi>Senacharib</hi>'s Hoaſt; they will not ſee God's hand. Nor when an arrow ſhot at a venture ſhall find out and ſmite a diſguiſed murtherer between the joints of his armour, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.33. yet others will not fear his juſtice, nor ſee the hand of the Lord. What can the Lord do more? Either he muſt give them up, or put them to ſhame with further miracles: And try whether <hi>Xerxes</hi> will fetter the Winds as wiſely as he ſettered the Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont, and chaſtiſe them alſo with ſtripes. But the Sea did not for all that acknowledge any Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to him, more than ours did to the good King <hi>Canutus,</hi> who tryed it, but only to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34461:17"/>rebuke and diſprove the flattery of ſome of his flattering Courtiers, who vainly and prophanely called him God.</p>
               <p>But neither thoſe Gentiles ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. nor any of thoſe Heatheniſh Atheiſts had that great Luminary to enlighten them, which our modern Atheiſts have, <hi>viz.</hi> the light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel of Chriſt; therefore as their light is greater, ſo muſt their ſin be, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation too, becauſe they will not ſee his light, who hath in his right hand ſeven Stars, and his countenance is as the Sun ſhineth in his ſtrength, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1. The God of this world hath various fallacies and deceits whereby he blinds and beguiles unſtable ſouls, and draws them to this.</p>
               <p>In ſome he blinds their mind with pride, as it is ſaid in the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> The ungodly is ſo proud, that he careth not for God, neither is God in all his thoughts, in the place before mentioned. They ſaid in the pride of their heart, <hi>The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn ſtone, Iſa.</hi> So we may read in the 37th. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> of <hi>Senacharib</hi>'s proud boaſtings, and how he blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the holy one of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and reproached the Lord; 24, and 25 <hi>verſes</hi> mention his boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.13. and 14. <hi>Know ye not what I and my Fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? Were the gods of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions able to deliver their lands out of my hands?</hi> 14. <hi>That your god ſhould be able to deliver you cut of my hand?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner <hi>Alexander</hi>'s proud and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious mind leading him firſt to thirſt after the inlarging of his Territories, left him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34461:17"/>and having conquered <hi>Athens,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a terrour to all <hi>Greece,</hi> he was choſen their Captain General. He then thirſted for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the world; thereupon he went into <hi>Aſia</hi> with his whole Army, and overcame <hi>Lydia, Ionia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and every Country that lay in his way. And at length engaging with <hi>Darius,</hi> his innumerable Army, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary preparations and Engines, he overcome them; and overrunning the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Dominion to the <hi>Indies.</hi> And at length becomes tranſported with the greatneſs of his fortune and ſucceſs, and forgets God, and aſſumes to himſelf Divine honours. And as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> was tranſported, and blinded with pride and ambition; ſo are others by luſt, covetouſneſs, drunkenneſs, gluttony, vanity, and other baits of Satan, quite blinded and beſotted, and held captive by him at his will, and are by inſenſible degrees drawn on fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further to caſt off all fear of God, and reverence to his worſhip. The ſame who now after the Conqueſt obtained, aſcribes and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to himſelf Divine honour, and calls himſelf God and <hi>Jovis, Hammonis filius.</hi> He before the joyning of the battel would by no means omit to ſacrifice to the gods of the place. So <hi>Curtius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sacrificium Dis preſidibus loci ſecit patrio more,</hi> he was not then an Atheiſt, nor yet a God.</p>
               <p>The ſame cauſes may we aſſign to that Atheiſm of <hi>Caligula;</hi> for how can we think of ſuch folly and pride, but that they were blinded and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with it? when juſt then he had counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the Thunder in his brazen Galleries made for that purpoſe, upon a ſudden clap of Thunder
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34461:18"/>he run and hid himſelf under his bed, and cryed out, <hi>Caligula non eſt Deus;</hi> he dared not then to threaten the Air, as at another time he did.</p>
               <p>Another Means or Obſtruction whereby Satan hinders the light of the Goſpel from ſhining into their hearts, ſo that they ſee not God, is ſucceſs in ſin and wickedneſs; hereby he that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizeth it, is emboldened in it, and takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to queſtion the Being of God, as he, <hi>Quis putet eſſe deos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And God ſuffereth them to proſper ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, grow mighty, and heap up ſilver as duſt, that his own people ſhould know how little to value the world, when he gives the Kingdoms thereof to the baſeſt of the people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1, 2. The Prophet did require of God the reaſon of their proſpering, and prays againſt them, <hi>Pull them out as ſheep for the ſlaughter.</hi> And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God ſuffereth it for this reaſon, which <hi>David</hi> mentioneth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. that he may caſt them down ſuddenly with the greater ruine. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.17, 18. But we find that this was a grievance to <hi>David,</hi> as it was to afflicted <hi>Job, Job</hi> 21. <hi>Wherefore do the wicked live?</hi> And ſo it is generally to all God's afflicted people; but mark the end of them, <hi>Job</hi> 27.13.</p>
               <p>Another Obſtruction that Satan makes uſe of to hinder this glorious Light of the Goſpel from ſhining into their hearts, is, That whatſoever ſin they perpetrate, yet they ſit at eaſe (like the people of <hi>Lachiſh</hi>) and find no changes nor alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in their eſtates and affairs, but all things go on after the ſame manner as before their ſins committed they did; according to the courſe of nature, and according to the means which they uſe in their callings.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:34461:18"/>
               <p>Sometimes the Lord is reſolved to make them ſee, and be aſhamed. According to that in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, c.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed.</hi> Thus he made the Thunderer afraid of Thunder, and aſhamed. So <hi>David</hi> prayed, <hi>Put them in fear, O Lord, that they may know themſelves to be but men.</hi> When they forget themſelves, they forget God. But oh how ſoon can God diſmay them, and make them recant whatever they dared againſt God in their pride of heart! when he pleaſeth to ſtrike them with fear and conſternation! And then thoſe who before proſeſſed themſelves wiſe, will confeſs themſelves fools, becauſe they can no longer ſhut their eyes againſt the light, but that they muſt ſee their ſhame.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible that Atheiſts make uſe of this argument of fear, to perſwade, that it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe that taught men the worſhip of God, according to that ſaying. <hi>Primus in orbe deos fecit timor.</hi> To this firſt by way of admiſſion I anſwer, that if it ſhould be admitted, yet that is a neceſſary, and a good fear which driveth us to God, and reſtraineth from evil. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom.</hi> But it is a bad fear which drives us from the face of God: as <hi>Adam</hi> after he had ſinned, was afraid and hid himſelf. So <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſenſe of his ſinfulneſs made him beſeech the Lord Jeſus to depart from him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By way of negation, I conceive that love moveth good people to the ſervice of God more than fear. 'Twas <hi>Abel</hi>'s Love to God which made him offer the beſt, and to think nothing good enough for God. Likewiſe it was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34461:19"/>want of love in <hi>Cain</hi> that made him offer with an evil mind, that which was not the beſt: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be ſlaviſh fear in him that cauſed him to give God any Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>But this motive of fear ſometimes moveth the moſt wicked that are to worſhip God; but when the fear is over, the worſhip ceaſeth, <hi>Job</hi> 24. And though in their troubles they vowed Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombs, they ſcarce will pay one of a hundred. Beſides, it is manifeſt, that the juſt and upright are little liable to fears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil, Pſal.</hi> 27. <hi>The Lord is my light and my ſalvation, whom then ſhall I fear? Pſa.</hi> 46. <hi>God is our hope and ſtrength, a very preſent help in trouble: Therefore will we not fear though the earth be moved, and though the hills be carried into the midſt of the Sea. Though the waters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of rage and ſwell, and though the Mountains ſhake at the tempeſt of the ſame.</hi> As the Poet ſpeaks of the juſt man, <hi>Si fractus illabatur orbis impavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ferient ruinae.</hi> Becauſe they that truly fear God, know that they need not fear any thing elſe. Therefore in the 37th. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> upon <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacharib</hi>'s great boaſtings and threatnings to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Juda,</hi> the word of the Lord by the Prophet was concerning her, <hi>The Virgin, the daughten of Zion hath deſpiſed thee, and laughed thee to ſcorn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not rehearſe the examples of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage of theſe people, becauſe they are ſo numerous I conceive that every one that hath a tongue to ſpeak, can tell a Catalogue of them: as <hi>Abraham, Gideon, Sampſon, Baruck, Jephta, David,</hi> and the <hi>Legio fulminatrix Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum.</hi> And on the other ſide, it is as notorious,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34461:19"/>and commonly known, that the moſt deſperately wicked ſinners and blaſphemers are moſt timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and fearful, and are full of fears, <hi>ſi vel her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam dimovere lacertae, &amp; corde &amp; gemibus tremunt.</hi> As <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> trembled when he ſaw the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing upon the wall, before he knew whether it were good or bad. Becauſe their guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience makes them fear where no fear is, and fly when none purſueth. It followeth, that if fear did make gods to be, they ſhould be the greateſt worſhippers of them; but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not truth, and therefore not the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent or ſuppoſition.</p>
               <p>Neither was it fear that made the differences of good and evil, true and falſe, juſt and unjuſt, honeſt and diſhoneſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but God who is the fountain of goodneſs, and truth, and being.</p>
               <p>But if for all this they will not be convinced to take God for their ſtrength, and the fear of God, and the wiſdom which is from above, for the true and ſound wiſdom, and ſtill will ſay to God, <hi>Depart from us, we will none of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Moſt High;</hi> and ſtrengthen and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage themſelves in their ungodlineſs, and in the multitude of their iniquities boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding they ſee their Policy, Wit and Ingenuity, whereof they ſo much boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be fruſtrated and baffled by thoſe means which they diſdained, and their ſecret ſins detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and puniſhed, and yet for all this they will not ſee the hand of the Lord. And their proud flaſhy wit leads them with <hi>Xerxes,</hi> to fetter the Sea, or the like vanities and extravagancies.</p>
               <p>Then let them go on in the waies that they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34461:20"/>have choſen, till ſuch time as the Lord ſhall pleaſe to put a hook in their noſe, as he did in that <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchs. And let thoſe who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the true wiſdom, goodneſs and humility, reſt aſſured of this; That <hi>the Virgin, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion ſhall deſpiſe them, and laugh them to ſcorn, Iſa.</hi> 37.22. And ſo with <hi>David</hi> we may and muſt all pray againſt the enemies of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.13. <hi>Conſume them, O Lord, conſume them, that they may periſh, and know that it is God that ruleth in Jacob, and unto the ends of the world.</hi> For thus only could <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> be brought to this knowledge, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.33. And thus by feeling that hand of God which they refuſe to ſee, let all thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be forced to acknowledge thee. And thou (O bleſſed Jeſus!) bruiſe them with a Rod of Iron, and break them to pieces like a Potters veſſel, becauſe they have ſaid, That thou ſhalt not rule over them.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>General Rules.</head>
                  <p>It appeareth from this, that it is not the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which God requireth, which is forced from them by compulſion, with an unwilling mind, as that of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the wilderneſs, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78.34. <hi>When he ſlew them, they ſought him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Rules which will ſhew us how to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God acceptably, are</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we pray, read, meditate, and perform the like ſervices to God from this belief. That we cannot ſpend our time in any worldly affair ſo well, or ſo much for our Profit, Joy, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Delight and Satisfaction, as in this or that duty.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. That upon theſe accounts we perform our ſervices to God, with all our might. Theſe three prove our cheerfulneſs and willingneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That we perform them conſtantly and early.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That we perform them inviſibly to man. not expecting any reward from men, nor a good word.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That we pride not our ſelves in our ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and diſpiſe others with a <hi>ſtand off, I am ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier than thou;</hi> but count our ſelves unprofitable ſervants, and deſire that our very beſt ſervices be cleanſed, purified, perfumed and accepted only through the merits and mediation of Chriſt Jeſus; and confeſs that we can offer him nothing but that which is his own; for he gives both the will and the deed that is good, and puts his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into us, and cauſeth us to walk in his ſtatutes, and confeſs alſo that we have need of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus as our High Prieſt, to bear the iniquities of our holy things.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That in all our ſervices which we perform we ſeek principally the glory of God. Thus we ſee that moſt of the petitions of the Lord's, Prayer are; and by thus doing, we give proof that we are God's children; for they ſeek God's glory, though it be with the ſpoliation of their own glory; as <hi>David</hi> dancing before the Ark.

               <p>THIS being the firſt Duty which we learn in our tender age, and the firſt in our daily practice, whether it be becauſe that the ſenſe of our own needs, and wants driveth us to ſeek our ſupplies and ſuccours from the omnipotent being, that we thus begin the day; or from the nature of man which being yet undefiled with the corruptions of ill examples, followes its own Inſtinct and inclination; and is therefore eaſily taught this practice, or elſe takes it in its minority; or whether it be that all do teach their infants this part of divine worſhip firſt, as moſt neceſſary, or that they are beſt capable of. So it is, that this is the firſt in order of practice, and eminent for its Vertue if it be rightly performed, and of moſt frequent uſe. It will be therefore proper enough to begin with a Regulation of my ſelf in this particular.</p>
               <p>Which that I may do, I will conſider</p>
               <p n="1">1. The manner, and circumſtances: And</p>

               <p>And 3. motives to excite my ſelf to it.</p>
               <p>The various manners of prayer are to be found in the Pſalms of <hi>David:</hi> And in thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which we read in ſcripture made by our bleſſed

               <p>The inward is particularly expreſſed in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. praying alwayes with all prayer, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Spirit. Watching &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the Spirit, muſt be the manner, for though Watching, faſting, and all other outward manners be had, if this be wanting only, it is but a lame, or blind Sacrifice. Becauſe as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>We know not what to pray for as we ought.</hi> Though we have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, <hi>ib. v.</hi> 34.

               <p>When thou art ſuch in thy prayers to God, and putteſt up ſuch petitions, with intention, ſighing, and groaning of Spirit, and not extention of voice, thou knoweſt by whoſe aſſiſtance it is, and that thou art accepted; therefore crave it of God. And though thou findeſt diſability in thy ſelf, or an indiſpoſition, becauſe the fleſh cannot keep pace with the Spirit, thou wilt find the interceſſion of the Spirit in thy heatr unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable; be not therefore diſcouraged or deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, becauſe thou canſt not pray vocally; for thoſe prayers that are not expreſſed, are as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful with God, as theirs that are well expreſſed; when thou findeſt in thy ſelf a deſire to draw nigh to God, do it, though thou wanteſt words: As
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34461:22"/>the fire from Heaven conſumed <hi>Elias</hi> Sacrifice: ſo look up to Heaven, and crave Gods aſſiſtance, and thou mayeſt find ſuch inlargement in the duty to put up effectual fervent prayers in the Spirit whereby thou mayſt take Heaven by force: our lifting up of our hearts to God moveth him to bow his ear to us. And having ſuch an Almighty Helper, what need we to fear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; let us truſt to our Succours.</p>
               <p>The Spirits Aſiſtance conſiſts in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>It excites holy deſires which are pleaſing to God, and ſometimes dictates them verbally, ſometimes without words, and expreſſions. The Spirit of Grace cauſeth a Chriſtian to beg for Spiritual bleſſings, comforts and injoyments, and to deſire, to long, breath, and pant after them unceſſantly. It cauſeth fervency of Spirit, firing our affections with holy Zeal for Spiritual gifts and Graces, injoyments, and ſatisfactions, helpes and improvements, and keeps up thoſe holy flames which it kindles. So that it preſerves us from looking back with <hi>Lots</hi> wife, from drowſineſs, ſlightneſs in performing duties, and from faintings tipified by <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God; it unites our hearts to God, and helps us againſt diſcurrency, of thoughts which naturally we are ſubject unto. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we are carried on in the duty by an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Spiritual enjoyments. It drives away fears, and doubts which are ſubject to ariſe from guilt; and ſupplieth us with a holy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and child-like deſpoſition, ingenuity and aſſurance, and freely opens our minds, to make known our requeſts to him, whereby we can call God Father, <hi>Gal. c.</hi> 4 <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>becauſe ye are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34461:22"/>Sons he hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your heart,</hi> whereby ye call him Father; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as oft as we find our Souls thus, let us wraſtle it out with God till we get the bleſſing and deſir'd grace. Men that want the Spirit of God have theſe three diſpoſitions, Slaviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Mercenarineſs, and Senſuality. They pray out of fear, and in doubt of acceptance; and when they have their deſires, their Prayers ceaſe, unleſs they be cuſtomary and formal Prayers, and they crave but ſenſual things. The Spirit alſo ſupplyeth a Chriſtian with holy ends, and repreſſeth carnal ends; ſo that in all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts we ſeek the glory of God as it is ſought in all the petitions in the Lords Prayer; in ſuch, the largeneſs of our deſires doth not hinder the obtaining of them, but furthereth rather; for he hath commanded, open thy mouth wide, and hath promiſe to fill it. The larger the deſires, the more pleaſing to God, and the more like to ſpeed, for the more of the Spirit is in them.</p>
               <p>There is no colour then, why any ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this duty, upon pretence of having the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for the Apoſtles, and Diſciples of our Lord continued in Prayer, and breaking of Bread, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had received the ſpirit; for God is to be found &amp; met with in thoſe ordinances, as he ſaith, he walketh in the midſts of the Golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks. And the Spirit is to be ſought in theſe; for the beſt of Saints have need of ſeeking it in a greater meaſure, and for continual ſupplies, and watering every moment; which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in and by their communion with God in this duty. But the more we have of the Spirit, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34461:23"/>more we ought to be converſant in this Duty, becauſe we are furniſhed with ability; and for not uſing our Talents, they may be taken away; and by uſing they are improved. And the more effectual and fervent they will be, by this, that they are more ſpiritual. Much leſs may we neglect prayer, if we think we have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for we pray for it.</p>
               <p>And this circumſtance of faſting and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſometimes joined with this duty, to the end our prayers may be more ſpiritual: I mean a Faſt from a meal that none may perceive, not a Faſt of 40 days, nor exchange of Fleſh for Fiſh. Faſting doth as much promote it, as the contrary doth let and hinder it; though poſſibly we may uſe the ſame expreſſion, full as faſting, yet they who have tryed know the advantage which this gives above that, to the fervency, and earneſtneſs, and the holineſs of our deſires and prayers, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſorrow for our ſins. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells his Diſciples of a ſort of Devils which could not be caſt out but by faſting and prayer. And <hi>Mark</hi> 9. <hi>Cornelius</hi> thus prayed, and thus <hi>Daniel, Dan. c.</hi> 9. both with good ſucceſs. <hi>David</hi> alſo humbled himſelf with faſting, for they knew well, that words of courſe, as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that coſts nothing, is nothing worth. And unleſs we thus pray in the Spirit, it appears we cannot pleaſe God, for the prayer cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be holy, and for ſuch things as are pleaſing to God? for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:34461:23"/>
               <p>Although we ought to pray in this manner yet nevertheleſs ought we not to neglect the duty, though we cannot perceive the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit; for God feedeth the young Ravens that call upon him. If they can call upon him, no man can pretend a diſability. And <hi>David</hi> in the 107 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſheweth how peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are plagued for their wickedneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they rebell'd againſt the Lord, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the counſel of the moſt high, <hi>v.</hi> 11, and 17. <hi>Yet crying unto the Lord in their trouble, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveretd them out of their diſtreſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though theſe prayers were extorted from them in their extremities, when their ſoul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd all manner of Meat, and they were even at Deaths door. And when they were at their wits end, and ready to periſh through their hunger, and thirſt, and bondage, which for their ſins they ſuffered, yet in their extremities they cry to God, whom they had ſinned againſt, and he delivereth them.</p>
               <p>Theſe were not ſuch prayers as are put up by the Spirit, for ſuch relief; even nature, though degenerated, can eaſily pray, but the dictates of the Spirit are ſpiritual, yet in regard the heart and lip go together, thoſe are preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, much more if prayed in faith.</p>
               <p>If God heareth ſuch prayers, and thou thy ſelf haſt obtained thy Requeſts for theſe or the like benefits, and temporal deliverances; thou mayeſt then be emboldened and encouraged to ask and continue praying for all thou lackeſt: as <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. <hi>I am well pleaſed that the Lord hath heard the voice of my prayer, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:34461:24"/>And if thou haſt been heard for things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, thou needeſt not to deſpair or doubt when thou prayeſt for thoſe things which are pleaſing to God, which he hath commanded thee to ask, and Jeſus Chriſt alſo hath commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to thee to ſeek, and promiſed to procure.</p>
               <p>Not but that a Child of God may and muſt by Faith, and by the Spirit, ask the things of this life; for our bleſſed Saviour teacheth us to pray for our daily bread; he pray'd, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this Cup paſs from me,</hi> yet, <hi>not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> This ſubmiſſion made that prayer which was natural, to be ſpiritual; although he prayed for that which he knew was impoſſible. And ſince God in his mercy hath given his peculiar people many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of temporal bleſſings; they may and muſt ask them in faith, in ſuch order as Jeſus Chriſt hath appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeeking the Kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof firſt, and with modeſty and ſuch other circumſtances as hereafter is expreſs'd, and God will grant our requeſts as far as is for our good.</p>
               <p>But that which is ſure to prevail, is the holy appetite, that planteth Hungers and Thirſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter righteouſneſs; for to that is the promiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, and bleſſing too. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thirsteth, come ye, Iſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour water upon him that is thirſty.</hi> The deſires of ſuch ſhall be ſatisfied, though not utter'd with full expreſſions, nor ſtrength of Lungs, as Prayers learn'd may be. Importunity, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt ſo much preſſeth, is comprehended under this of praying in the Spirit; for he taught nothing but what was ſpiritual. And his practice
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34461:24"/>too proves it to be the operation of the Spirit, that makes us importunate in Prayer; for when he prayed he was frequently in agonies, and prayed moſt earneſtly. It reproves thoſe that mind other things, when they pray; how ſhall God mind their prayers? what he teacheth and urgeth for this is in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. where he ſheweth that for our importunities ſake we are hear'd of God, and argueth, that we ought always to pray, and not to faint; to which agreeth, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Pray without ceaſing.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe our Saviour teacheth, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.5. Where he ſheweth that Importunity prevailed more than Love and Friendſhip, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15. It is ſaid, <hi>I poured out my Soul before God.</hi> Zeal maketh Importunate, and fervent in Spirit ſerving the Lord. If our Lord and Saviour ſweat blood, we muſt undergo ſome pain; and if we apprehend the greatneſs of the benefits which we beg, it will make us zealous.</p>
               <p>Another part of the manner which our bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saviour hath enjoined, is to ask in his name, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs,</hi> &amp;c. He hath not only commanded it, but to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the command, annexed a promiſe of reward, as large as we can deſire, <hi>John</hi> 14.13. <hi>Whatſoever ye ask the Father in my name, I will do it;</hi> this is an odoriferous perfume to our prayers. In his name, every knee muſt bow; it is not at his name in the original. He is our only Mediator and high Prieſt who ever liveth to make interceſſion for us. He preſents them, and recommendeth them to his Father, mixing them with ſweet odours, &amp; purifying them from thoſe corruptions of our nature, which attend them, as Salt water is made freſh by paſſing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34461:25"/>through the bowels of the earth. And there is no Mediator to this Mediator; and we muſt needs know our own unworthineſs to be ſuch, that there is nothing in us to deſerve accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Another part of the manner is, that we pray in faith, firmly believing that we ſhall receive; he that prayeth for wiſdom, St. <hi>James</hi> bids him ask in Faith, nothing wavering, <hi>James</hi> 1.7. He forbids that man to think that he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing of the Lord that wavereth, and calls him a double-minded man; for as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige men to be real to us, and faithful by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them, ſo we do God. This manner of praying is commanded in many places; to this belongeth waiting upon God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. There is no promiſe to thoſe prayers which ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition hath made to the bleſſed Virgin, nor no command for them; therefore they are not of faith.</p>
               <p>Another part of the manner is, that we pray with reverence and humility, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. <hi>Bow down thine ear, O Lord, and hear me, for I am poor and needy. Pſal. Let us draw nigh to him with reverence, and Godly fear, for our God is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire.</hi> The conſideration of God's great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and almightineſs, muſt needs beget a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in our approachings to him. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence is diſcribed in the Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. <hi>The Publican ſtanding a far off, could not ſo much as lift up his eyes to Heaven, but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying Lord be merciful to me a ſinner.</hi> 6 <hi>Mich.</hi> 8. <hi>What doth the Lord require of thee, but that thou do juſtice, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God. Iſa.</hi> 57. <hi>He reſiſteth the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34461:25"/>proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</hi> The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were injoyned, that when they came before the Lord with their Sacrifices, they ſhould ſay, A <hi>Syrian</hi> ready to periſh was my Father, and came down to <hi>Aegypt</hi> with a few. We come as Beggars to him for his almes, and having nothing but what we receive of him, we muſt therefore aſcribe all to his goodneſs and bounty, as we have an example, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6. <hi>The Lord killeth, and maketh alive, bringeth down to the grave, and up again, ver.</hi> 8. <hi>he raiſeth up the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth up the Beggar from the dunghill, to ſet them among Princes.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.7. He ſaith, <hi>To him will I look that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The lifting up of a pure heart, and clean hands, and a reverent poſture of the body, are mentioned as neceſſary in the manner of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whileſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his hands were lifted up, <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed; but when they were down, the <hi>Amalakites</hi> prevailed. Our Saviour fell on his face, and prayed. He hath alſo taught us paucity of words, as moſt agreeable to the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, Highneſs, and dignity of God; and condemneth vain repetitions which inculcate the ſame thing again; for theſe are nauſeous both to God and men, and are as much the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of fools, as their prayers who neglecting all other things, of the manner of praying and matter too, think it enough to ſay <hi>Amen.</hi> They bring religion almoſt to nothing, that they may gain the more proſelites. He enjoyneth alſo, The circumſtances of place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. That our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayers be put up in private places where no eye ſeeth but God alone; for ſuch prayer
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34461:26"/>is ſincere, becauſe it expects a reward from him only. Hypocriſie expects it from men. The ſame circumſtance he requires in faſting, Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds alſo, and a perfect reconciliation to our offended brethren is required, to make our prayers acceptable as our Lord, and Saviour teacheth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Leave thy gift before the Altar, go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then offer thy gift.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. the Apoſtle commands to <hi>pray without wrath, and doubting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The circumſtance of Time is alſo material; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we have alwaies need to pray becauſe of the manifold temptations we meet with, yet we read of the Apoſtles, that they went up to the Temple at the hour of prayer. That ſheweth that there is a time deſigned for that duty, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. and <hi>Apocal.</hi> 1. St. <hi>John</hi> was in the Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lords day, for though this duty is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſeaſonable, yet there be Special ſeaſons, as we may find by experience wherein we are freer in our holy deſires, and better diſpoſed, and God is nigher; the oportunity in every work is half the work, therefore obſerve theſe <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſima tempora fandi.</hi> As under the law. The firſt fruits were to be Sacrificed, and the firſt that opened the womb were to be holy to the Lord. By a parity of reaſon the ſervices that we do to God, under the Goſpel, are to be of the firſt things. <hi>Remember thy Creater in the days of thy youth, Eccles.</hi> 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>Early will I ſeek thee;</hi> and the reaſon of his ſo ſeeking is in the following words, <hi>my ſoul thirſteth for thee;</hi> ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>my voice ſhall thou hear betimes in the morning; and early will I direct my prayer unto
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34461:26"/>thee, and will look up, Pſal.</hi> 5. <hi>when I awake I am preſent with thee, Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> But he that ſeeketh not early, may ſeek long, before he find an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time. We read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3. <hi>In proceſs of time it came to paſs that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the Lord. And Abel, he alſo brought of the firſtlings of the flock, and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had reſpect unto Abel, and to his offering, But to Cain, and to his offering he had not reſpect.</hi> The difference of the offering ſhewed the ſincerity of <hi>Abl</hi>'s heart above <hi>Cain</hi>'s. For he offered, but it is not ſaid the firſt fruits of the ground, but the contrary is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the oppoſition of the offerings, and by thoſe words which God ſpake to him, <hi>viz.</hi> If thou do well ſhalt not thou be accepted? From whence we are taught this Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> That they who will offer their ſervice, or any thing to God, may not offer any but the beſt. Nor defer the time to ſerve him, for that which we defer, we are loath and unwilling to do, or indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we do it or no; that which we deſire to do, or do with good will and love, we haſten, fearing leſt we ſhould be prevented. The more forward and early our ſervices are, the more acceptable to God and men, for this perſumes them. <hi>Now is the accepted time.</hi> He then that deferreth loſeth the Accepted time, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.13. <hi>David</hi> urgeth it as an Argument why God ſhould hear him, and deliver him, becauſe he made his prayer in an accepted time, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſlip not the ſeaſonable time though thou be indiſpoſed. He that is early in his ſervice, and conſtant too, cannot poſſibly miſs the accepted
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34461:27"/>time when God will be found, as he was found of <hi>Cornelius.</hi> For theſe two are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>David, ſeek the Lord while he may be found; ſeek his face evermore,</hi> for by this we ſhall be ſure not to miſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.1. The Saints firſt and only refuge is prayer, and it is the laſt refuge of the wicked. They who fear they ſhall be prevented of their uſual time, let them take the preſent. It is a high point of Wiſdom to know the fit time and place, and the ignorance of it makes the miſery of man great. <hi>David</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed what he taught, and did not only ſeek early, but late too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. he ſaith, <hi>Let the lifting up of my hands be as an evening Sacrifice.</hi> The morning, and the evening Sacrifice were not to be omitted, and he that doth omit them, or either of them, finds his mind leſs diſpoſed for the duty, and the injoyment and comfort of it, which he uſeth to have when he performeth them without intermiſſion; for by the omiſſion of one duty, God ſeemeth to be withdrawn, and gone further from us, and not ſo ready to be found, or to hear us, by how much we have withdrawn from him, and neglected, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him. We alſo find <hi>Iſaac</hi> going out to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the evening. And <hi>Daniel</hi> perſiſted in his practice of praying three times a day, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the peril of his life. <hi>David</hi> kept the ſame times, as he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. <hi>At evening at morning, and at noon day I will pray unto thee.</hi> Love &amp; need cauſe frequent &amp; early viſits; thoſe who are greatly beloved of God, &amp; God beloved of them, do pray often. Weread of other circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtances, as that of <hi>Daniels</hi> opening his windows, and looking towards the temple; but we are not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34461:27"/>reſtrained to this manner of ceremonies, for thoſe things are aboliſhed by the ſubſtance; the more we obſerve of theſe circumſtance, the more joy, comfort and ſatisfaction we ſhall reap by the duty. Take time enough for preparation, for if thou ſtraiten thy ſelf, thou mayeſt be diverted. But we are commanded to pray alwaies with all manner of prayer, that is as the occaſion will permit, or requires, for there are various man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we cannot be alwaies upon our knees in publick prayers, or in private; nor muſt one duty juſtle out another. All times, and all places afford us opportunity and occaſions of lifting up our hearts, and hands to God in the Heavens, which may be accepted ſometimes as well as Sacrifice. And as in heaven we ſhall never ceaſe from praiſing God, ſo while we live here we ſhall never ceaſe from praying to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. <hi>I give my ſelf unto prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, this duty, (that it may be acceptable) doth require preparation &amp; premeditation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.19. <hi>thou prepareſt their heart, and thine care harkneth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of prayer; Which is Twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> The Inducements to be uſed, and the ſubject matter for which we pray</p>
               <p>Seldom is there any prayer without Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and motives perſwaſive, with which we urge God, and preſs him to grant us the things we deſire.</p>
               <p>The Lords prayer, which is as brief as may be, concludes with three Inducements, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>thine is the Kingdom, the power, and the Glory, for ever, and ever. Amen.</hi> We find in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> variety of thoſe. Sometimes he urgeth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34461:28"/>the promiſes of God, Sometimes the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, ſome motives he fetcheth from the name of God, ſome from his nature, and being, as from his Truth, his Holineſs his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Faithfulneſs, his Mercy, his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, his Juſtice, his Righteouſneſs his Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>He urgeth the pledges of Gods love already beſtowed, his loving kindneſs of old. And his thankful acknowledgment of them. Alſo he urgeth his Relation as Servant, <hi>I am thy Servant, O grant me underſtanding that I may know thy ſtatutes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some he urgeth from his own Miſery, Need, Neceſſity, Trouble, and Affliction.</p>
               <p>Some from his Innocency, uprightneſs, ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſincerity, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.</p>
               <p>Some from his holy deſires, Intents, vows, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and Reſolutions, and his ſervice done for him. <hi>His</hi> hope in God, his Truſt and affiance in him. His love to him, and his word.</p>
               <p>He urgeth alſo, that he makes his prayer in an accepted time, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Hear me O Lord, and I will keep thy ſtatutes: Let my Soul live, and it ſhall praiſe thee; Let thine hand helpe me, for I have choſen thy Commandments; give me underſtanding according to thy word.</hi> So that we ſee that it is a good motive when we ask any grace, to ſhew how we have endeavoured and uſed the means to attain it, as he doth, &amp; purpoſe to uſe them. In this <hi>Pſalm</hi> throughout he ſhews how he ſtudied Gods ſtatutes, meditated and delighted himſelf in them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. He urgeth his truſt. <hi>In the O Lord have I put my truſt, let me never be put to confuſion.</hi> This Motive he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth very often (as though truſting did engage
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34461:28"/>God not to fail him). It followeth. <hi>Be thou my ſtrong hold whereunto I may alwaies reſort. For thou haſt promiſed to help me.</hi> In the two next verſes he urgeth his love, and deſire of God, as an Argument why he ſhould deliver him from his ungodly enemies.</p>
               <p>And this motive he uſeth often, and he very often uſeth that of his promiſe. In the 9 <hi>ver.</hi> of this <hi>Pſal.</hi> he <hi>urgeth</hi> his trouble. <hi>Mine enemies ſpeak againſt me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Go not from me, O God my God, haſt thee to help me. Look upon my affliction and miſery, and forgive me all my ſin. From my youth up thy terrors have I ſuffered with a troubled mind,</hi> &amp;c. In the 12, 13, 16, 19. and 20. <hi>verſes,</hi> he urgeth his Reſolutions of truſting in God, waiting upon him ſerving him and praiſing him, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>As for me I will patiently abide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies and praiſe thee more and more,</hi> 13. <hi>My mouth ſhall daily ſpeak of thy righteouſneſs, and thy ſalvation; for I know no end thereof. I will go forth in the ſtrength of the Lord, and make mention of thy Righteouſneſs only.</hi> And prayeth, <hi>Forſake me not in the time of mine Age, when my ſtrength faileth me, until I have ſhewed thy ſtrength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Generation, and they Power unto all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. He urgeth his holy Reſolutions: <hi>Give the King thy judgements,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then ſhall he Judge the people according to right, and defend the poor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He ſhall keep the ſimple folk by their right, and puniſh the wrong doer.</hi>

               <p>In the 38 <hi>Pſal.</hi> he alſo urgeth the malice, and wickedneſs of his enemies, together with his own ſorrow, and miſery, by reaſon of his ſins, and his enemies, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Thine arrows ſtick faſt in me, and thine hand preſſeth me ſore.

Of his enemies he ſaith, they were againſt him becauſe he followed the thing that is good, but he will confeſs his iniquities; theſe motives introduce this prayer. <hi>Haſt thee to help me O Lord God of my ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 4 <hi>Pſal.</hi> He makes uſe of Gods former benefits as a motive for further beneficent ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Hear me when I call O God of my Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> (the motive) <hi>for thou haſt ſet me at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty when I was in trouble, Pſal.</hi> 86. He urgeth his afflictions, he ſuffered under Gods hand, and his enemies malice, and the goodneſs, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God. And concludes, <hi>O turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Uſual in his prayers is that expreſſion for thy Name ſake. They who would make uſe of this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34461:29"/>as all muſt, muſt know him in that name which he himſelf proclaimed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. For <hi>David</hi> did refer to this, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and gracious, long ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth; keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, and tranſgreſſion and ſin,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord cannot forget his own name, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot forget to be gracious. If we can uſe that inducement of <hi>Moſes, Lord, if I have found favour in thy ſight,</hi> it is peculiar to his favourites, and obligeth God to hear.</p>
               <p>This is a large Field, and may afford great plenty and variety; but every man may ſupply himſelf with it, that liſt to read and obſerve the Pſalms. It is noted by Biſhop <hi>Cooper,</hi> that it is not ſufficient to ſeek from God, becauſe of that which he is, but we muſt alſo conſider what we are: Otherwiſe, as <hi>Jehu</hi> ſaid unto one demanding, <hi>Is it peace? What hast thou to do with peace?</hi> So the Lord may anſwer us, though the Lord be gracious, what is it to us?</p>
               <p>As to the ſubject matter of Prayer; the Children of God are ſometimes miſtaken about it, and are in doubts. St. <hi>Paul</hi> accordingly confeſſeth in the behalf of himſelf, and others, <hi>we know not what to pray for as we ought.</hi> We find <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo miſtaken in the matter of his Prayer. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18. <hi>Shew me now thy Glory,</hi> for God anſwer'd him, that no man could ſee his face and live; and that he could not ſee it; yet Almighty God, to ſhew his propenſity in hearing prayer, came as neer his requeſt as he could for God anſwered him in that which was as profitable and uſeful for him. He made all his goodneſs to paſs before him, and let him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34461:30"/>ſee his back-parts, ſo that <hi>Moſes</hi> loſt not his Prayer, though he did not obtain the thing he asked. Much more may we expect ſucceſs in our Prayers, when we ask ſuch things as he hath commanded us to ſeek, which we know are according to his will; and our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour alſo hath engag'd for our obtaining. The invitations being ſo many, ſo importunate, and ſo free, <hi>viz.</hi> To come, and buy without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and without price; to open our mouths wide, to ask and have; it appears, and we muſt ſo believe, that Gods bountifulneſs is ſuch, that he is more ready to give, than we to ask or receive. And like as a Mother, whoſe breaſts are full, is more deſirous to give ſuck to her Babe, than that to crave, or receive it; ſuch is Gods freeneſs to us.</p>
               <p>It concerns us then to adviſe what theſe rich benefits are, which we are to beg, and buy without money, or price. And if we may have what we lack for asking, certainly we ſhall be convinced of the greateſt folly in the world, if we will loſe them for want of asking.</p>
               <p>Many are ignorant of their own wants, as the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who knew not that ſhe was wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked, but thought herſelf in the contrary eſtate. But God adviſeth her of her wants, and the remedy of it, which he ſheweth her, is to be had of him only, <hi>viz.</hi> Gold tried in the fire, that ſhe might be rich, and white raiment that ſhe might be cloathed, and eye Salve, that ſhe might ſee; and freely invites her to buy them of him, though ſhe were poor, blind, and naked, and had nothing to purchaſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34461:30"/>them withall, therefore we may infer that all men, be their condition what it will, may come to God in this duty of Prayer, for all their needs, as we read, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.5. <hi>The Mareners cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one to his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our better direction, that we may not miſcarry in our ſuits, as the Mother of <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> Children did, our bleſſed Saviour hath plentifully inſtructed us what we ſhould pray for; as he here directs the Church of the <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceans, Matth.</hi> 6.9. and <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. The Diſciples ſenſible of their own inſufficiency, do make it their ſuit to him to teach them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he gives a pattern, and rules for them and us to uſe.</p>
               <p>In which Prayer the three firſt, and the three laſt petitions are ſpiritual. According to the rule which he gives, <hi>ver</hi> 33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof.</hi> From this prayer of our Saviour, and the rules by him given, and from the precepts elſewhere, and the prayers of the Saints, we find but theſe three things neceſſary to be prayed for, <hi>viz.</hi> Grace, and the means of Grace, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards promiſed thereto.</p>
               <p>For, though the Children of God do moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſe confeſſion of their ſins, and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings together with their Prayers, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did. And <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms are moſt of them thus; and whether we uſe them as inducements for the things we pray for, as we uſe confeſſion, as an inducement for pardon, and thankſgiving, may and ought to be uſed as an inducement for obtaining further mercies, or elſe we look upon them as diſtinct duties; they are proper
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34461:31"/>enough, but not always neceſſary to be joined with this duty; therefore we refer them to their proper places, and judg them much more eaſy as to the verbal expreſſion than fervent Prayer for grace, and ſpiritual enjoyments.</p>
               <p>When God hath filled our heart with food and gladneſs, and hath wrought deliverance for us, and ſo hath given us, matter of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; if the Heart be but enough thankful, words of praiſe and outward actions cannot be wanting; but thankſgivings and confeſſions are peculiar things: and for this duty, this one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive may be ſufficient to enforce it, <hi>viz. That it pleaſeth the Lord better than a Bullock that hath Horns and Hoofs, Pſal.</hi> 69.32.</p>
               <p>Theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> Grace, and the means of Grace, and the rewards, I conceive they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the promiſes, and all that God hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd by the new Covenant to give to his people. They contain alſo all that God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and enjoyned his people, and requireth of them; and they contain all that they need, or can deſire to make them happy here and hereafter.</p>
               <p>And there is no Petition in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> or in any prayer in all the Scripture, but is contained under one of theſe heads; for all the Prayers of the Saints tends to this end, <hi>viz.</hi> The glory of God, and the promotion of his Kingdom, and the means thereof.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Prayers which are againſt the oppoſites, namely, againſt ſin and iniquity, and the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and helps thereof; and againſt every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſin, and the puniſhments and curſes due to ſin and ſinners, <hi>That the rod of the Wicked
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34461:31"/>may not reſt upon the lot of the righteous, Pſal.</hi> 125. Theſe are of the ſame nature with the former, for the overthrowing, plucking down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of ſin, and Satans Kingdom, and the treading him under foot, is the preparing the way of the Lord, that his Kingdom may come; therefore we do in this pray againſt thoſe, and in praying againſt thoſe, we pray for this.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that God hath made promiſes accordingly of ſubduing our iniquities, and to tread Satan under our feet. <hi>That no Weapon formed againſt us ſhall proſper. That ſin ſhall not have dominion over us.</hi> And we pray for the performance of theſe promiſes, when we pray the ſecond Petition of the Lord's Prayer, <hi>(Thy Kingdom come,)</hi> for the Kingdoms of the World cannot become the Kingdom of the Lord, and of his Chriſt, but by the ſubſerſion of Antichriſts Kingdom.</p>
               <p>This, notwithſtanding it is our duty to pray expreſly, as we are ſtrengthned, and aſſiſted by the holy Spirit, as well for theſe, as againſt thoſe, and againſt thoſe, as well as for theſe; although implicitly he that prays for the Kingdom of God, prays againſt ſin, and Satan. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity, &amp;c.</hi> Likewiſe when we pray thus generally in theſe words of our bleſſed Saviour, we do implicitly pray for the converſion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Yet ought we notwithſtanding expreſly to pray for it, becauſe we are commanded to give him no reſt, till he make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a praiſe.</p>
               <p>What perſons we are to pray for, is alſo taught by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>I will therefore that Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:34461:32"/>giving of thanks be made for all men;</hi> but yet we are chiefly to pray for the choſen people of God; for thereby we expreſs, and declare our fellowſhip with them, and our relation to them, as members of the ſame myſtical body, in Chriſt Jeſus, and thereby endeared to us more than our natural relations. Therefore we find the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles praying for thoſe they write to, and requiring the like of them again. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> prayeth for them, <hi>c.</hi> 1.17. That God would give them the Spirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and revelation in the knowledg of him; that their underſtanding being enlightned, they might know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints. And what is the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his power to us-ward, who believe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.16. Prayeth <hi>that they may be ſtrengthned with might by the Spirit in the inner-man; that they may know the love of Chriſt:</hi> for the Saints at <hi>Philippi</hi> he prayeth, <hi>that their love may abound more and more, in knowledg, and all judgment, that they may approve things that are excellent, that they may be ſincere, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, till the day of Chriſt, being filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt, unto the praiſe, and glory of God,</hi> Philip. 1.9.</p>
               <p>By theſe, and the like Prayers of the holy Apoſtles, we learn what to pray for as well for our ſelves, as others.</p>
               <p>We learn from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer for the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, c.</hi> 13. To pray <hi>that God through the blood
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34461:32"/>of the everlaſting Covenant, would make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every good work, to do his will, working in us that which is pleaſing in his ſight, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ.</hi> For it is through Jeſus Chriſt, if any thing we do is pleaſing to God; and it is God himſelf who works it in us.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that do not pray for the peace of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> are not Citizens thereof; therefore they do not love her. But they that do pray for her peace, and give God no reſt, until he make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a praiſe, are Citizens of that <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which is from above, which is the mother of us all; and they receive comfort from her welfare, and are ſure that ſhe ſhall receive a benefit by their Prayers, and hope to receive benefit mutually by her Prayers; for as the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles to the Churches pray for them, ſo they do alſo deſire their prayers.</p>
               <p>I infer, that every particular Chriſtian in his Prayers muſt put in ſuit the general promiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> That all her people ſhall be holy, all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, all be taught of God, and holineſs to the Lord ſhall be writ upon the Bells of the Horſes. They who pray for theſe Spiritual gifts and graces; for themſelves and others, do pray in the Spirit, and ſeek the Glory of God. And by their fervency, and zeal, and frequent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to God for them; and for repreſſing, and ſubduing their oppoſites, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſins which ſo eaſily beſet them, their iniquities and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They ſhew forth their wearineſs of them, and burthen which loadeth them, from which they groan and cry to be eaſed and deliver'd by God, becauſe they are not able by all they can do, to be deliver'd by their own induſtry.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34461:33"/>And becauſe our bleſſed Saviour hath promiſed to eaſe ſuch, therefore they may be ſure to be heard; if they (confeſſing their particular bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of corruption, whether it be pride, anger, malice, revenge, covetouſneſs, luſt, concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, or the like, and mourning over it,) humbly intreat him to ſuccour, relieve, help, heal, cleanſe, waſh, purge and purify them by the renewing of the Spirit. Or elſe (as he anſwer'd St. <hi>Paul</hi> praying againſt the Thorn in his fleſh) he will ſupply them with grace ſufficient for them.</p>
               <p>From theſe promiſes we may ſee the reaſon why our bleſſed Saviour in that form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, teacheth us to pray in the plural number, <hi>our</hi> and <hi>us;</hi> for this includes our ſelves, and our fellow-members of the myſtical body of Chriſt, ſome whereof are but Babes, or Children in religion, and cannot pray for themſelves, as not having received ſo great meaſure of the Spirit, ſo that they have need of our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and our charity, including them, doth not hinder our requeſts for our ſelves, but rather promotes them.</p>
               <p>We ſee alſo why ſometimes they pray more particularly, but for themſelves as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did againſt his particular malady, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then which he groaned under. And ſo <hi>David</hi> did pray againſt his own particular ſins and ſufferings; <hi>Deliver me from bloody-guiltineſs; Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken me in thy Law; Incline my heart to thy Teſtimonies, and not to covetouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. For which particular graces, we may upon occaſion, pray in the behalf of others, according to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34461:33"/>that precept of the Apoſtle. <hi>If any man ſee his Brother ſin a ſin, which is not unto Death, he ſhall pray for him, and it ſhall be forgiven him,</hi> Likewiſe may we pray for the deliverance of them from their afflictions, and perils which they lie under, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſires the Saints to whom he wrote, to pray for his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance; for nature dictates theſe prayers for our ſelves, but grace, for others that are our Brethren in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Hope of ſpeeding is that which incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, and excites with ſtrength and courage in every undertaking we go about.</p>
               <p>If we ſeek of God in prayer the things which are according to his will, thoſe gifts, and graces, and Improvements, which he hath promiſed to give, thoſe things which he hath invited us to ask, or commanded us to ask; thoſe that our Saviour and his Apoſtles have taught us to ask; thoſe which the experience of other Saints and ſervants of God proves to be acceptable and proper requeſts; thoſe graces which we are commanded to have, thoſe degrees of grace, and thoſe means which we are commanded to uſe, and thoſe ſpiritual joys and injoyments which we long for, and cannot be happy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, why ſhould we doubt of our ſucceſs? or why ſhould we not expect a quick Return?</p>
               <p>Let us then apply our ſelves to ſeek out thoſe things.</p>
               <p>As the original of all graces, we firſt are taught by our Saviour to pray to God, to give us the Holy Spirit: And he that obtains this, obtains alſo the fruits of it. Love. joy, peace, meekneſs, gentleneſs, patience &amp;c. And all
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34461:34"/>graces whatſoever: for as the Lord taught us our whole duty in one word, <hi>viz.</hi> Love; ſo here he teacheth us in one word, the ſum of all we need to pray for; for although we pray for many things, yet the ſum of all ſpiritual things is contained in this. And if we ſeek the ſpiritual gifts, and graces, which is ſignified in that expreſſion, Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, the other things ſhall be added unto us without ſeeking. In this alſo is ſummed up all that we ought to pray againſt, <hi>viz.</hi> all our ſpiritual enemies, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life, and every thing that Satan over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſons of men withal.</p>
               <p>This general is branched into ſix petitions in the Lords prayer; for by the Spirit of God in us, we are made holy, the Temples of the Lord, and are made capable to ſanctify Gods holy name, the love of God is ſpread abroad in our hearts, Gods law is written in our hearts, and put in our inward parts. By the Miſſion of the holy Spirit into us, we all know him, and know his Judgments, and do them: the Kingdoms of the World become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt, Righteouſneſs will run down as a River, and holineſs, to the Lord ſhall be writ upon us, and all our comon things; every pot in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be like the bouls before the Altar. And Jeſus Chriſt ſhall have the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion; when theſe and the like promiſes are fulfill'd. And the earth ſhall be full of the knowledg of the Lord, ſo that we pray implicity for theſe promiſes when we pray theſe petitions in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34461:34"/>Lords prayer: likewiſe when we pray, Thy will be done, we pray for the Spirit to enable us to do it, and we pray to God for the fulfilling of thoſe promiſes of the New Covenant which relate to it, <hi>viz.</hi> That God will be our God, and we ſhall be his people; that we ſhall run, and not be weary, walk and not faint, mount up with wings like an Eagle, and renew our ſtrength like an Eagle, that we ſhall be a willing people.</p>
               <p>So in the other petitions, Namely, that for remiſſion of ſins, we cannot be aſſured of it, nor have peace of conſcience, but by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Ghoſt in our hearts by faith, exciting in us unfeigned ſorrow for thoſe ſins, wherewith we have grieved it, and working in us a ſtedfaſt reſolution and purpoſe never to commit the like again. Alſo when we pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Temptations, it is intended that we crave this aid by the aſſiſtance of Gods Holy Spirit, to eſcape them; for thereby we are made ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and able to fly them, or to overcome them, and to be more than conquerors; ſo that no Spiritual weapon formed againſt us ſhall proper. And if God gives us his holy Spirit, we obtain alſo the other petitions, namely, to be delivered from evil, and to enjoy food, and raiment, and all the neceſſaries of life; for theſe are inſeparably contained in the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Saints: For God is a Wall of fire round about them; bread ſhall be given them, and their water ſhall be ſure; ſo that petition alſo is (by reaſon of the promiſe) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that of asking the holy Spirit. The rather for this, that all other promiſes of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34461:35"/>New Covenant are implyed in this. This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, we find the Saints and Servants of God praying in other words, and formes, and by the Spirit too. Whoſe Aſſiſtance I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave, for my further progreſs in theſe meditations.</p>
               <p>Certainly when the Holy Spirit aſſiſts us in prayer, it doth not only inable us to ſay or pray in a perſcribed form, but dictates the words, and things prayed for, according to the neceſſities of the perſon praying, and prayed for.</p>
               <p>Although we are not under the law, but under grace, that being dead wherein we were held, that we ſhould henceforth ſerve God, in the newneſs of the Spirit, and not in the oldneſs of the latter.</p>
               <p>Yet muſt we pray againſt all thoſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nature, called the old man, thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and weakneſſes, and indiſpoſitions to the new nature, to grace, and to the meanes of grace, and for thoſe graces, thoſe helpes, and occaſions, and meanes of grace, which the Saints, and Servants of God under the law, have prayed for, and God promiſed to give them.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance, all thoſe petitions of <hi>David,</hi> in the Pſalms, ſhewing his own corruptions, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, failings, ſins, and infirmities, wandrings, and ſtrayings from Gods Commandments, and praying for the Lords help againſt them, we now under the Goſpel, if we flatter not our ſelves (as ſome ſects do) we all at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhall find by ſad experience, that we have need to pray ſo too. And thoſe that are moſt renewed, and moſt conformable to the Image of God, thoſe ſearch out moſt, and know there
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34461:35"/>own failings, in grace, and proneneſs to ſin; for it may be ſaid of us, All have ſinned, and are juſtified freely by his grace; for if St. <hi>Paul</hi> counted not that he had atttained perfection, but preſſed forward, neither may we imagine, that thoſe of this age, who pretend to it, have attained it; <hi>for in many things, we offend all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore in as much as thoſe graces are to be in us which they ſought, and prayed for, that they ſhould be in them, we alſo are to imitate their examples of praying for them, and the improvement of them, and againſt the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> the corruptions and ſins which we find our natures liable to.</p>
               <p>Every mans condition doth ſhew him what temptations he is moſt liable to, and what gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he hath moſt need to pray for.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that will be rich, the Apoſtle ſaith, fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and divers noiſome luſts, they will be rich though: therefore have need to pray againſt thoſe temptations of pride, anger, diſdain, oppreſſion, contention, ſtrife, wilfulneſs, covetouſneſs, love of the World, and all thoſe luſts which accompany a plentiful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; as gluttony, drunkenneſs, effeminateneſs, the love of pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that they may eſcape all thoſe ſnares whereby the Soul is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and held captive, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe advantages which they have of ſinning with impunity; thoſe helps which their wealth miniſters, and all the opportunities which wealth makes for them; that by the help of Gods holy Spirit, they may be able to take off their affections from things below, that ſo they may ſet them on things above; that they affect not, mind nor,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34461:36"/>nor converſe with theſe things of the world which they have plentifully to enjoy. That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their abundance, they may have their converſation in Heaven, and mind only heavenly things, and uſe the World as if they uſed it not; buy as if they poſſeſſed not; and be rich in good works; and may be able to deny themſelves; and may be crucified to the World, and buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, and riſe again with him in newneſs of life, that the life which we now live, we may no more live it, but Chriſt may live in us; and the life which we live, we may live by the faith of the Son of God who loved us, and gave himſelf for us.</p>
               <p>A ſpecial help and incouragement it is to us, if we can find out a promiſe of obtaining theſe graces, which we thus pray for in time of need; for having theſe precepts (as here before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) it urgeth us to the practice of them, as the Apoſtles profeſs they practiſed. But the promiſe puts hope into us, of obtaining the like graces, if we ſeek them by Prayer, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and other means appointed by God to be uſed. The promiſe then, which we may urge, and charge God with, in our prayers, may be this, <hi>viz. The Sun ſhall not burn thee by day, nor the Moon by night;</hi> or that, <hi>That all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God.</hi> For theſe promiſes were therefore given to us, that we ſhould have boldneſs at the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>The contrary condition of life, Poverty, hath likewiſe its temptations.</p>
               <p>Therefore we find the wiſe <hi>Agur</hi> praying e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34461:36"/>againſt it, and riches; ſhewing the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of both; and the bleſſedneſs of the middle or mean eſtate. Thoſe that experience the extremity of poverty, not having a place where to lay their head, have many promiſes of a God alſufficient to truſt unto; and he will never leave nor forſake his Servants.</p>
               <p>In like manner other conditions of life are accompanied with multiplicity of temptations. Therefore the Scripture gives cautions, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions to all to warn them, and arm them againſt them; young and old, Maſters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Parents and Children, Husbands and Wives, Kings and Subjects, Prieſts and People: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans daily experience tells him what temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations he lies under; and his proneneſs of nature, and inclination to them; which when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in particular warns us againſt, and inſtructs us how to avoid; we know that we ought by Prayer, to ſeek aſſiſtance and help from God; becauſe without his almighty help we are not able to overcome them.</p>
               <p>For inſtance; The Lord commanding to fly youthful luſts. If we find our ſelves, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination, liable to thoſe luſts, we may (as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath given us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) Beſeech the Lord that this Meſſenger of Satan may depart from us, and never ceaſe to beſeech him, until we obtain an anſwer like to that which he obtained, ſufficiency of grace, or elſe removal of the temptation; and as often as it recurs, we may pray with holy <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Hold thou me up, and I ſhall be ſafe.</hi> And whileſt we do continue praying, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God; why may not we be confident
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34461:37"/>in it, as the Apoſtle was; That the Lord will deliver us from every evil work, ſince the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to all that truſt in him; That he will ſtand by them, and ſave them, and deliver them.</p>
               <p>Or if by nature we are inclined to covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>David</hi>'s prayer will ſtand us in ſtead; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline my heart to thy Teſtimonies, and not to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like ſort, he fearing to be overtaken with that common ſin of lying, prayed to God, to <hi>take from him the way of lying,</hi> to grant him his Law, and to teach him his ſtatutes; for he well knew, that there was no remedy againſt ſin but grace. And the Law of God dwelling in his heart, that he might run the way of God's Commandments without halting, or looking back.</p>
               <p>If we have been overtaken with this ſin, this prayer ſuits for our occaſion; for by praying to God to take from us the way of lying, we intend we have more of it than we ought, and ſo probably he intended, or elſe how could it be taken from him?</p>
               <p>And if we ſhould be ſo unhappy as to be ſo overtaken with luſt as he was. If in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our ſoul, and ſorrow of a broken heart; waſhing our bed with our tears, having no health in our fleſh, nor reſt in our bones, becauſe of God's diſpleaſure: We pray as he did (with humble confeſſion of our ſins, and vileneſs) to him, to waſh us, cleanſe us, heal us, pardon us; to turn his face from our ſins, and blot out our miſdeeds, according to the multitude of his mercy. Then, though for the preſent they are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34461:37"/>ever in our ſight, terrifying and troubling us, we ſhall in due time, know, that they are pardoned; and that the blood of Chriſt hath cleanſed us from them all; and that we are reconciled in him; and he will heal us; and we ſhall again be reſtored to the joy of our ſalvation, and praiſe his Name in his Courts, and renew our vowes, and be ſtabliſhed with his free Spirit.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> contain prayers for ſome graces, and may ſtand us in ſtead for our uſe, and ſerve for our direction.</p>
               <p>If we are raſh or chollerick by nature, and ſubject to wrath and revenge, and have fallen thereby, or fear we ſhall fall. We cannot be enough ſenſible of our danger, in this particular, becauſe we muſt expect hourly temptations, and how far our wrath and choller may carry us, we know not (eſpecially if we ſhould chance to meet with others, as chollerik and raſh as our ſelves) if we do not alwaies pray to God to help us in, and deliver us from this temptation, (as it is, for the moſt part in all the ſins of our complexion, or inclination, very difficult to ſtand againſt them at all) if God do not ſtand by us, and ſtrengthen us, and ſupport us; and if we forget our ſelves, and do not hang upon him for help, call upon him, truſt in him, and fear and diſtruſt our ſelves. Theſe will alwaies be buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting us.</p>
               <p>He that is ſenſible of his weakneſs in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and his danger, and mourns by reaſon thereof, deſiring to be delivered from it, ſeeks help by reading, meditation, conference, and this means of prayer, which muſt alſo be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the other, beſides the uſe of natural means
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34461:38"/>too: For ſo we find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> uſing them; for he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I keep under my body. We ſtrive and run as in a Race. So fight I, not as one that beateth the Air. In labours often, in ſaſtings often, &amp;c.</hi> For hereby we both ſhew to God, and man, our burthen, that we groan under, and deſires to be delivered from it; if we uſe all theſe means to get our deliverance. But on the contrary; how little deſire to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from wrath or luſt doth he expreſs, who ſeeds himſelf to the full, drinks wine in bouls, pampers his body with high feeding and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are the fewel of theſe fires? or how doth he ſeek humility of God, who delights himſelf in actions of vain-glory, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of men, and ſeeks honour of men by bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, revenge, vain oſtentation, high looks, a lofty gate, pomp, prodigality, and the like. Certainly thoſe ſins which by nature we are moſt inclined to, theſe by natural helps and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juments we muſt oppoſe; not cheriſh and foſter by incitements and allurements. The wiſe <hi>Agur</hi> accordingly prayed againſt the means of ſin, and the occaſions, againſt the means and occaſions of fulneſs, and want. If we ſo well knew our own proneneſs to theſe mother ſins, as he did, and were ſo wiſe as he was, we would pray as he did, to be delivered from the means and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſins. This is contained in that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like ſort praying for any grace, or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a grace, we muſt uſe the means, both ſpiritual and natural; and pray for them, and the occaſions of them; as mortification, ſobriety, watchfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence we are taught to pray
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34461:38"/>to God to ſend us Paſtors, who ſhall feed his people with knowledge. And becauſe this is a neceſſary means of grace, God hath promiſed it, and by the promiſe we are invited to ask it. Suitably we find <hi>David</hi> praying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.12. <hi>Teach me thy Statutes; v.</hi> 18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may ſee the wondrous things of thy Law; v.</hi> 26. <hi>I have acknowledged my waies, and thou heardeſt me; O teach me thy Statutes. Make me to underſtand the way of thy Commandments. Make me to delight in the thing that pleaſeth thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More eſpecially in this ſpecified ſin of wrath and revenge; if thou laboureſt under it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to be delivered from it, and the evils and dangers attending it; thou pondereſt and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditateſt of thoſe Texts of Scripture which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and repreſs it; as is that, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it, ſaith the Lord. Let not the Sun go down in your wrath. Leave thy gift upon the Altar, and go and be reconciled, and then offer thy gift. Prov. It is the wiſdom of a man to paſs by an offence. Anger reſteth in the boſom of fools. If when ye ſuffer wrongfully ye take it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, happy are ye, for the Spirit of grace and glory reſteth upon you.</hi> Thou ſhalt reap improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy patience in a good meaſure by theſe meditations. And by ſubduing thy body, and withdrawing from it ſuperfluities (eſpecially ſuch as more naturally excite this humour in thy body) and by careful watching againſt the firſt beginning of wrath.</p>
               <p>And then if thou add to theſe this laſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer, beſeeching God through Jeſus Chriſt <hi>(who is made unto us wiſdom, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34461:39"/>ſanctiſication, and redemption)</hi> to make us ſo wiſe as to paſs by offences for his ſake; and to take from us that folly of anger; that as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not him, ſo it be not in us neither, who are his children, who doth good to all; that we may be like him in this; and that by our ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to anger, and by our patient, bearing of wrongs, and our meekneſs and ſubmiſſion to God (if it be his will that we ſhall ſuffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) we may perceive, and know, that the Spirit of grace and glory reſts upon us; and in that rejoyce.</p>
               <p>Then we may be aſſured that we ſhall obtain the victory over theſe luſts and meſſengers of Satan; and be able to do good for evil; to love our enemies; to bleſs them that curſe us; to pray for thoſe that deſpightfully uſe us; and ſo run the waies of Jeſus Chriſt's Commandments, and take up his yoak.</p>
               <p>I ſay, we may be aſſured of obtaining theſe excellent graces by theſe meanes: becauſe God hath promiſed it in the proheſie of <hi>Iſa. c.</hi> 32. <hi>The heart of the raſh ſhall underſtand knowledg. The Lion ſhall lye down with the Lamb, c.</hi> 29.4.</p>
               <p>Certainly the change of the heart, and reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in knowledg, and underſtanding is the chief thing in our Quickning, and vivification in the Spirit, and in every grace; this God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving often undertaken, and promiſed. As in that promiſe, <hi>That he will take away the heart of ſtone, and give his people a heart of fleſh. And that he will give them a New heart, that he will put his Lawes in their hearts, and write them in their inward parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may aſſure our ſelves that he will do it.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34461:39"/>If we ſupplicate him in faith in Jeſus Chriſt: And uſe our own endeavours with the meanes. And if we do obtain this, ſo that we can ſavour the things of God, and delight our ſelves in the Lord, and count all the waies of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments pleaſantneſs, ſearch for them, as for hid treaſure, dig for them, ſeek them evermore; we have obtained the greateſt, and chiefeſt matter, and the reſt we may aſſure our ſelves, that we ſhall by the like means obtain: and by degrees be able to run the waies of Gods commands: diſcretion ſhall preſerve us, and underſtanding ſhall keep us, and deliver us from the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and allurements to theſe and other ſins we ſhall be able to keep our watch againſt our ſpiritual enimies, that would deſtroy us.</p>
               <p>But although our heart be thus changed and we renewed, ſo that with our mind we do the Law of God, yet it is great danger but that ſometimes with our fleſh we ſhall ſerve the Law of ſin, becauſe, when we would do good evil is preſent with us: unleſs the hand of God continually hold us up, which that it may, we muſt invocate his mercy, and almighty power; uſing all the means premiſed, and with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs againſt the firſt beginning of evil, <hi>Oculus ad coelum, Manus ad clavum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that our ſureſt perſervative is this of prayer, although we are renewed in the Spirit of our mind. Our own wofull experience tells us ſo; (as this holy Apoſtle tells us by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.)</p>
               <p>For we know how that we have often endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured our ſelves to hallow the name of God, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34461:40"/>of our complexion, and to avoid the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And to that end and purpoſe have read, meditated, heard the word preached, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the practice of it; we have made that covenant with our eyes, as <hi>Job</hi> made with his, or the like, to avoid and ſhun the occaſions of that ſin which we moſt fear. But yet upon trial we have found in our corrupt hearts, ſo much of the old unregenerate man, that when we would do good, evil hath been preſent with us, and ready to ſurprize us, and lead us captive. And how to do the good we would, we know not, and we could only bewaile our wretched condition, crying out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin, and death!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore we muſt be alwaies at the Throne of Grace, as thoſe holy men were; <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>Make me to underſtand the way of thy Commandments, v.</hi> 35. <hi>Make me to go in the paths of thy Commandments, v.</hi> 36. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline my heart to thy teſtimonies and not to coveti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> 37. <hi>Turne away mine eyes leſt they behold vanity, and quicken me in thy Law,</hi> 38. <hi>Stabliſh thy word in thy Servant that I may fear the.</hi>

               <p>If we accordingly practice. And with ſuch holy deſires, pantings, and breathings with ſuch ſervency of affection, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

(For the Spouſe her ſelf, though ſhe be aſſured of her Beloved's kindneſs and love towards her, and her own love reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards him; ſo prayes, <hi>Draw us, we will run after thee</hi>) which ſheweth what great need we have of craving God's almighty help, when we are ſtrongeſt; and with <hi>David</hi> have ſworn, and are ſtedfaſtly purpoſed to keep his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgments.</p>
               <p>If we do accordingly pray, then we may alſo obtain to be men after God's own heart, as he was; for we have a promiſe for it, <hi>viz.</hi> The weak ſhall be like the houſe of <hi>David.</hi> He will incline our hearts to his Teſtimonies. He will work in us both the will and the deed. He will order our ſteps in his Word. He will draw us, and we ſhall run after him. And we ſhall do his will on Earth, as it is done in Heaven. And he will order our feet in his Word. Direct our going. Make us to delight in that which is good. And though our ſoul be alwaies in our hand, yet we ſhall not forget his Laws; but claim them for our heritage and portion for ever.</p>
               <p>Becauſe he is true, who hath promiſed to guide us, lead us, keep us, uphold us, ſtrengthen us, watch over us, to be with us in trouble, to deliver us; to tread Satan under our feet; that no weapon formed againſt us ſhall proſper; that he will water us every morning, and every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and we ſhall run, and not be weary, mount up with wings like Eagles, and renew our ſtrength like the Eagle; and he will make
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34461:41"/>our way perfect; and thoſe that are planted in the houſe of the Lord ſhall flouriſh in the Court of God; they ſhall grow from ſtrength to ſtrength, and grow up like the Calves of the ſtall. And though we do fall when we are confident in our own ſtrength, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> did; yet ſhall we riſe again: But he that feareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies is more happy; for he will watch againſt the beginnings of evil actions, and will uſe theſe means premiſed, and ſhall not fall; for God will hold him with his hand, becauſe he truſteth in him only; and will bear him, as a man doth bear his Son, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.31.</p>
               <p>And as we are taught in the precedent inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo may we ſuitably be inſtructed out of the holy Scriptures in all other temptations to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins. If it be exceſs in drinking; which raging vice hath invaded a great part of the world. And men are not content to allow themſelves in it, but generally ſtrive to draw in all thoſe with whom they converſe, in ſpight, as it were, of all holy admonitions, moral precepts, natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, policies, prudential conſtitutions and councels of the moſt renowned wiſe men, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuos men, moſt excellent Law-givers: And their own daily experience of the miſchiefs and ruines that this ſin brings upon thoſe that are guilty of it.</p>
               <p>The remedies whereof being ſo much predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and ſo little practiſed, muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world of a great deal of practical A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Infidelity. But thou that ſeeſt this fault in thy ſelf, and art grieved at it, deſiring to be delivered from it, and findeſt it as difficult as to cut off thy right hand, or pull out thy

               <p>Becauſe God hath ingaged to be found of them that ſeek him; to help them that have no power, nor ſtrength; to be with thee in the fire, that it ſhall not burn thee, and in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that it ſhall not drown thee.

               <p>But it would ſeem tedious to run through all the ſins which humane nature is prone to, and to adapt the promiſes in holy Scripture to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſins and luſts, under which we labour, and deſire to be eaſed. I therefore purſue it no further, the rather, becauſe the precedent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are eaſily imitated by thoſe who read, and meditate in the Scripture, which all they do, who deſire to break off their ſins by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>This Direction I conceive to be neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe who come to crave a promiſe of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34461:42"/>God, do alſo conſider the qualification; and in the firſt place ſeek that, elſe the promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to thee. For example, if in thy trouble thou prayeſt that all things may work together for thy good, pray alſo, that he would circumciſe thy heart, and cauſe thee to love him with all thy heart: And pray for this in the firſt place, for the other will follow upon it. This is according to God's own direction. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and the Righteouſneſs thereof; all other things ſhall be</hi> thrown in <hi>to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this manner we are to put in ſuit all the promiſes. We muſt look upon the promiſed bleſſing as the invitation and incouragement to ſeek the grace that is the qualification; and he who prayes for the grace, implicitely and moſt ſtrongly, prayes for the promiſe annexed. And there is no grace but hath a promiſed reward annexed; a cup of cold water given in charity, ſhall not loſe its reward; or but two mites where little is. Then we muſt believe that no good works ſhall loſe its reward.</p>
               <p>And there is no bleſſedneſs promiſed to any, but thoſe who are qualified with this or that grace, as may be ſeen in the 5th. of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> Goſpel, and in other like places.</p>
               <p>And he that ſeeks godlineſs, ſeeks all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this life, and that which is to come, as incident thereto; therefore ſeek this firſt: For many that have the qualifications of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and bleſſedneſs, are yet in doubt whether they are ſufficiently qualified, and think that they ought to be better qualified for them, and deſire to be better qualified, as well for their own joy and comfort, as alſo that they may be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34461:42"/>more excellent and lovely in the eye of their Lord and beloved Saviour. And grace wherever it is, begets a holy thirſt for a greater meaſure, and will ſtill thirſt, till it enjoy the higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of degrees in glory.</p>
               <p>Therefore they pray chiefly for grace, and the improvement of every grace in themſelves and others, according to that <hi>Col.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Since the day we heard of it, viz.</hi> Their love in the ſpirit, mentioned in the 8th. <hi>verſe) we ceaſe not to pray for you, and to deſire that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtanding.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 4.12. <hi>That ye may ſtand perfect and compleat in all the will of God, Phil.</hi> 1.11. <hi>And be filled with the fruits of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the Bleſſings, Rewards and Promiſes which God hath made, and limited to thoſe who have theſe graces and qualifications.</p>
               <p>No man that prayeth for them in the behalf of thoſe that are qualified, can doubt of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing; as when we pray, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Let all thoſe that ſeek thee rejoyce, Pſal.</hi> 40.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.22. <hi>Let thy mercy (O Lord) be upon us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we hope in thee, Pſal.</hi> 25.21. <hi>Let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and uprightneſs preſerve me, for I wait on thee;</hi> and the like. Becauſe we oftener find theſe bleſſings and rewards poſitively aſſerted to be the portion and peculiar priviledges of thoſe that ſeek God, call upon him, love him, delight in him, truſt in him, rely upon him, have their mind ſtayed on him, hope in him, fear him, and wait upon him. Then we have found them particularly prayed for, in the behalf of them who are ſo qualified. Yet we do well to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34461:43"/>pray for them, as well for our ſelves, as for the whole Church of God.</p>
               <p>Now in regard there be many promiſes free, and without any condition on our part, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us, when we fear that we are not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for a promiſe, that we preſs God with thoſe promiſes which are free, as that, <hi>I will love them freely, Hoſ.</hi> 14.4. <hi>I will pardon their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I will heal them. Hoſ.</hi> 14.5. <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon them, Joel</hi> 2.28. <hi>I will put my Laws in their hearts, and write them in their inward parts, Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will be merciful to them, and their ſins and their iniqnities will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no more, Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>He will ſubdue our iniquities, and caſt our ſins into the bottom of the Sea, Mich.</hi> 7.19. <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy ſins, Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>Pſal. He will teach ſinners in the way, Iſa.</hi> 32.4. <hi>The heart of the raſh ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, Iſa.</hi> 42.7. <hi>He ſhall open the eyes of the blind, Iſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground.</hi> Theſe, and many others are promiſed upon very little or no conſideration to be performed on our part. As ſome are for asking, ſeeking, coming to God, looking up to him. If we had the ſagacity of the Canaanitiſh woman, we ſhould perceive a door of hope through a little cranny.</p>
               <p>For God will be ſometimes prevailed with for a very petty conſideration performed from a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere heart, becauſe he knoweth our frailty. This <hi>David</hi> well knew, when he prayed, <hi>Let the liſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34461:43"/>up of my hand be as an evening Sacrifice.</hi> So did the woman that brought two mites to inrich the Treaſury. And the Thief upon the Croſs. Alſo there are promiſes, which are meerly free, and grounded upon the privation and want of all conſideration on our parts, as that; <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait to be gracious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And at other times the Lord will not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed withal, but with great intreaty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of prayer, and faſting, and alms-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: As we read our bleſſed Saviour told the Diſciples in the caſe of diſpoſſeſſing unclean ſpirits.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Cornelius</hi> alſo with his prayers uſed faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and alms, much.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes the Lord will not be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with at all, as he ſaid to the Prophet, <hi>Though Noah, Daniel and Job ſhould entreat, &amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commands him not to pray for that people: and though <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould intercede, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1. As it is ſaid in the firſt chapter of <hi>Proverbs, Becauſe when I called, ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded, but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof, I alſo will laugh at your calamity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs we muſt continue praying, though the Lord ſeems inexorable; for though he tarry long, it may be that he only intends to exerciſe thy faith and patience, and other graces. And he will fulfil his promiſe for thy delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in his own time, not thine. The Rod of the wicked may reſt a long time on the back of the Righteous, but ſhall not alwaies.</p>
               <p>With this direction too, that thou obſerve
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34461:44"/>when thou prayeſt againſt any affliction or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, that thou chiefly prayeſt againſt the cauſes of them, and thoſe ſins upon which God uſeth to threaten and denounce thoſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, eſpecially if thy conſcience tell thee of any particular ſin which might procure them.</p>
               <p>And that thou ſubmit to him who ſends it, with patience (if his will be not to remove his hand) confeſſing it to be his mercy, that thou art not conſumed, and hear the Rod, and him that appointed it.</p>
               <p>And (if by thy great afflictions) thou beeſt deprived of all comfort, and made the ſpectacle of all miſery, yet thou art to truſt to thy amends at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Though worms conſume thy fleſh, yet it may be comfort enough to ſupport thee, that thou know that thy Redeemer lives, and thou ſhalt ſee him at the laſt day. So <hi>Job.</hi> By execution ſome go to Heaven, as the Thief upon the Croſs.</p>
               <p>The promiſed Bleſſings and Enjoyments, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, Deliverances and Immunities, and earthly Comforts, muſt not be taken or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood abſolutely, but ſubordinately and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively, <hi>viz.</hi> as may conduce and further the ſpiritual and eternal welfare of thoſe who are heirs to them, and have title to claim them; therefore they muſt be ſought with ſubmiſſion and modeſty; as we find <hi>Jacob</hi> praying but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for food and rayment; and our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour, when he prayed, that the bitter cup of his ſufferings might paſs from him, it was with ſubmiſſion, <hi>Nevertheleſs not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe theſe prayers are the dictates of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34461:44"/>which the Saints and Servants of God do not uſe to inlarge, but ſuppreſs; albeit God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes grants them with an overplus; as when <hi>David</hi> asked life, and God granted him long life, <hi>viz.</hi> for ever. <hi>Solomon</hi> wiſdom, and God gave him beſides, riches and honour. And <hi>Jacob</hi> asked but food and rayment, and the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed him to two bands. And <hi>Abraham</hi> a child, and God granted him ſeed like the ſand of the Sea.</p>
               <p>But in theſe prayers too we do not find the dictates of Nature only, but the dictates of the Spirit uſually combining in the ſame petition; For it is probable that <hi>Hanna</hi> did deſign the Glory of God in asking a child, as the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to God gives reaſon to ſuppoſe; although we read of another cauſe which was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts which ſhe ſufferd for her barrenneſs, and her grief thereof conceived, which drove her to ſeek to God for ſuccour, and praying, vowed, if God would give her a male Child, then ſhe would give him to the Lord all the days of his life, which vow ſhe performed.</p>
               <p>If we alſo praying for ontward bleſſings vow, and retribute to God, our prayers are warranted, and are ſpiritual. Eſpecially if we deſign the glory of God therewith.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have received ſuch prayers with an overplus, are much more bound to conſider what they ſhall retribute, and if they they have vowed too, let them perform, leſt they loſe all again for their unworthireſs, and Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>And with theſe cautions God doth ſometims allow beggars to be chuſers, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> what ſex her Child ſhould be. And ſo <hi>Lot</hi> got <hi>Zoar</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:34461:45"/>to be ſpared, when God had appointed it to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The good Emperour <hi>Titus</hi> thought it an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming thing that any perſon ſhould depart from his Princes preſence ſad; therefore he granted all petitions; then ſhall not his Prince be much more gracious?</p>
               <p>To ſue to God upon his own promiſe is an argument of faith, much uſed by the faithful people of God: as we find in many of the Pſams. And an argument wherein God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, as he doth in every work that is of faith. And no man that ever prayed thus, loſt his labour. I cannot affirm that they alwaies obtain the things of this life, becauſe they are not abſolutely promiſed.</p>
               <p>Though godlineſs hath the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come, and no good thing ſhall be wanting to thoſe that live a godly life; they that fear the Lord ſhall want no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thing that is good, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. Yet theſe worldly bleſſings are not abſolutely good for every perſon, in every condition, therefore are not abſolutely promſed. But yet if we do ſeek theſe bodily comforts by uſe of means, we ought to joyn prayer with the means, elſe God will fruſtrate the means. As we read 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. he did when <hi>Aſa</hi> ſought to the Phſiycians to be healed, and not to God.</p>
               <p>But ſpiritual mercies, and graces, and the gifts of the Spirit, are abſolutely good, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely promiſed, and every man may, and muſt ſeek them evermore, becauſe they are commanded to have them, and to ſeek them, and they are promiſed to thoſe that ſeek
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34461:45"/>them, and thoſe who ſeek them not, are threatned.</p>
               <p>Thoſe graces which we have, we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to retain, and keep of our ſelves: the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Apoc.</hi> 2.2. was labourious, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, zealous againſt evil perſons, tryed the pretended Apoſtles, and for the name of Chriſt Jeſus laboured herein without fainting. And yet for all that reproved in the next words: <hi>Nevertheleſs I have ſomewhat againſt thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love.</hi> The like pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils (I ſuppoſe) attend all the Sarvants of God. (Though ſome are of opinion that the Elect cannot fall away) yet we ſee they do ſall foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And therefore they ſhall do well to pray to God for ſupportation. As <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. prayeth, <hi>Hold thou me up, and I ſhall be ſafe.</hi> And he prayeth for all graces in particular, but it cannot be ſuppoſed that he was deſtitute of all, therefore it is certain that he prayed for many which he then had; Probably becauſe he was ſenſible of his weakneſs, and danger of falling, if God did not water him every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and every moment, as he hath promiſed to do, or if God did not keep him, watch over him, ſtrengthen him: hold him up with his arm, which the Lord hath promiſed to do. Therefore we may be ſure that we need it all. And that he muſt be ſought too to perform theſe gracious promiſes. And the Lord will keep, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in us thoſe graces which we have. And deliever us, and ſave us from thoſe corruptions, and luſts which we think we are free from; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we who ſeem both naturally and ſpiritually fortified againſt ſome ſins, may fall in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34461:46"/>the thing wherein we excel; for ſo did <hi>Moſes;</hi> he ſpake unadviſedly with his lips, though he was the meekeſt man upon the earth. What perfection then can any man pretend to, in any grace, ſo great, as not to need continual pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God to ſupport him, water and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him, with his grace, and holy Spirit? leſt he fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> proteſts his delight was in Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 39. And yet he there prayeth, <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>Make me to go in the paths of thy Commandments: Incline my heart to thy Teſtimonies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In regard the people of God do eſteem grace a thing infinitely deſirable, and ſin infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable, and formidable, therefore they think they have not enough of any grace, till they can do Gods will on earth as it is done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And think they are in danger of falling, becauſe they have ſeen great Saints ſometimes to fall into dreadful ſins. Therefore pray to be kept from all ſorts of ſins; <hi>Keep me from preſumptuous ſins,</hi> ſaid holy <hi>David;</hi> and they think they can never fear them enough, or fly them enough, nor pray againſt them enough.</p>
               <p>The wickedeſt of men will pray for remiſſion of ſins, but they ſeldom pray for healing them, and renewing their hearts, that they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Gods Commandments, that they may be a holy people, and that God would ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful his promiſes of grace in them, to put his Spirit in them, and to write his Laws in their inward parts.</p>
               <p>It is curſory with common ſwarers, upon their oaths, to ſay immediately God forgive me,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34461:46"/>and preſently ſwear again. This ſhews no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, nor ſorrow for ſin, nor deſire of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; it rather begs licenſe to offend with impunity: what other thing do thoſe who make their daily confeſſion to their Prieſts and Friers of ſuch ſins which they have committed, and intend to commit again, upon the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and never think of repentance, or amendment; to pray for it themſelves, or to deſire others to pray for them; prophane <hi>Eſan</hi> ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt them.</p>
               <p>But do thou pray to be deliver'd from thy offences, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.9. That God would create in thee a clean heart, and eſtabliſh thee with his Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. And that God would open thine eyes that thou mayeſt ſee the wonderful things of his Law, and that he would teach thee his Statutes, and make thee to go in the paths of his Commandments, and the like; and then thou wilt be ſure of pardon and ſanctifying grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. and peace of conſcience, and that thou haſt fellowſhip with God the Father, and Jeſus Chriſt his Son, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. And thy joy ſhall be full, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>ib.</hi> Becauſe thou abideſt in him, walking as he walked, though not ſo perfect.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo pray for theſe graces with a full purpoſe and reſolution of endeavouring our ſelves to the utmoſt in the uſe of the means for attaining them, otherwiſe our Prayers are but only ſaid as Children are taught to ſay a Prayer. It is but lip labour, to draw nigh to God with our lips, when our hearts are far from him.</p>
               <p>And thoſe who pray for any grace which God
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34461:47"/>hath promiſed, and reſolve not to uſe their own endeavours for the attaining it, do not pray in faith, becauſe they ſeparate the Commandments from the promiſes. For he that hath promiſed to give them to us, hath alſo commanded us to get them, and to labour for them, to ſtrive for them, to ſell all for them. And yet to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue inſtant in Prayer for them too, that he would bleſs our endeavours, and give us the deſired grace for Jeſus Chriſts ſake, in and by whom only thou canſt hope to prevail.</p>
               <p>We muſt alſo be ſenſible of our own need, which we have of theſe graces which we ſeek, or elſe we ſhall not be ſervent in Prayer. For inſtance, if thou prayeſt to God to fulfil that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he will tread Satan under thy ſeet, thou muſt be ſenſible of this, that he doth in ſome temptations, get ſome ground of thee more or leſs, for which thou art grieved, and counteſt it thy unhappineſs. It may be, thou perceiveſt thy ſelf to have been more angry than became a patient man, or that thou haſt ſpoke more than thou didſt perfectly know of thine own knowledg, or elſe haſt (through the bad example, or importunity of thy company) drunk one Cup too much, or haſt had unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thoughts, or been tempted to any ſin. Thou art therefore grieved that Satan hath found any thing in thee to work upon, and doſt deſire ſo much ſtrength as to ſhake him off re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and readily at thy will and pleaſure, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhook off his Miſtreſs, if God will be pleaſed to grant it, according to this promiſe, and many more to the ſame eſtect: Thou muſt alſo be ſenſible of the great advantage and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34461:47"/>which the grace deſired will bring. If thus thou canſt pray, thou mayeſt be ſure to ſpeed whatever promiſed grace thou deſireſt, whatever degree of grace any Saint of God hath had, thou mayeſt have it for asking, if thou ask in faith. The patience of <hi>Job,</hi> the chaſtity of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> the zeal of <hi>David,</hi> the Juſtice of <hi>Lot,</hi> the righteouſneſs of <hi>Noah,</hi> the meekneſs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> the charity of St. <hi>John,</hi> the temperance of the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and love of God, whereby they gave their bodies to be burned for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For God hath promiſed, that the weak ſhall be as the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> as God.</p>
               <p>It is not my ſcope to enumerate all thoſe promiſes of grace which God hath made, it is every mans great concern to know them, and crave them of God, as their portion, which Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed with his blood for them; and to live upon them, and lay hold on them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe general promiſes which God hath made to his Church and People; if thou canſt not clearly entitle thy ſelf in particular, thou mayeſt notwithſtanding pray in the behalf of the Church, and ſhalt not fear to ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe promiſes which tend to the ruine of the enemies of the Church, and God's enemies, are every mans concern to pray for: and though he be weak in faith, that he can hardly lay hold of them, yet if he pray for them, that God may be glorified, he doth well, and may aſſure himſelf that he ſhall ſucceed, becauſe he ſeeks it for God's glory. For the promiſes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſin, and Satan, and his works, and tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34461:48"/>him under foot, is God's own intereſt, as well as ours. And God is more ready to do it, than we to ask it; therefore we can never doubt of the granting of theſe petitions.</p>
               <p>Now, moſt of the promiſes of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which are to expreſs what God will do for his people, are of this nature either what God will do againſt their enemies, or for them. And being they were freely made, they may (we hope) be freely performed (if we ſeek them.) Theſe are briefly contained in the four laſt petitions of the Lord's Prayer; and if we can find faith to believe that we ſhall receive theſe, we ſhall eaſily find faith to believe that God will do the other, which are briefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the three firſt petitions of the Lord's Prayer.</p>
               <p>Since it is ſo, that we muſt pray to God for every grace, and every good thing, we are to know, that we cannot have them of our ſelves without his gift. If we know how often we have reſolved againſt any particular ſin, and yet when we have but entred into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we have again done the like. Though we muſt needs acknowledg this, and pray to God that we be not any more tempted. And aſcribe it to him that he ſuffereth us not to be tempted above our ability.</p>
               <p>That we may be able to ſtand, let us diligently conſider, and weigh all thoſe ſnares of Satan whereby we are ſubject to be overcome, and have fallen, and more eſpecially watch, and pray againſt theſe, that thou mayeſt be able (through the ſpirit) to overcome them. And pray allſo againſt ſuch temptations which thou
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34461:48"/>ſeeſt other men overcome by, and doubteſt whether thou thy ſelf couldeſt have reſiſted. And particularly thoſe, whereby thou readeſt in the word of God, that men have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, eſpecially thoſe whereby good people have fallen; beginning with our firſt parents temptation to eat of the fruit of the Tree of knowledg.</p>
               <p>For though our bleſſed Saviour hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Satan for us, yet muſt we overcome him alſo, and tread upon him; therefore hath he forwarned us, and armed us to fight, and given us his Spirit to aſſiſt us in praying, and fighting, and watching againſt him, and his temptations, <hi>viz.</hi> The cares of the world, and the vain pleaſures and deceitfulneſs of riches, and perſecutions, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Pray then, that thou mayeſt not hearken to any of the ſuggeſtions of Satan, much leſs believe them, as <hi>Eve</hi> did. (Though he pretend kindneſs) nor give ear to thoſe who are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by him, as <hi>Adam</hi> did to her, though he knew that the ſuggeſtion came from Satan.</p>
               <p>Beware that the conſideration of the many graces which thou findeſt in thy heart, do not embolden thee to tranſgreſs, or make bold with God in ſmall matters, for which fault ſome of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were reproved, and ſeverely threatned, but pray againſt this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Look not upon what thou haſt, ſo much as upon that thou wanteſt, and comeſt ſhort in.</p>
               <p>Sometimes Satan ſpeaketh directly againſt Gods word, alledging that to be no ſin which God hath forbid, or that the puniſhment which God hath threatned, ſhall not be inflicted, but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34461:49"/>the contrary good ſhall be to the ſinner, thus he dealt with our firſt Parents, and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And thus he attempted our Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he extenuates it; ſometimes he makes uſe of the falls, and ſins of other Saints, and Servants of God, as an excuſe for us, if we do the like; ſome are perſwaded they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when they will.</p>
               <p>To ſome he pretends, the Goſpel to be a law of liberty, and a licence to ſin, and that they ſhall not be condemned for ſinning, but for want of believing the Forgiveneſs, and Remiſſion through the blood of Chriſt, through whom we Hope for mercy. To this I anſwer, that we muſt ſeek glory by grace; he that doth not ſo, will miſs it; <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy name; my ſoul thirſteth for God, Pſal.</hi> 42. And many other prove this.</p>
               <p>And when ever he makes uſe of true premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he inſers falſe concluſions.</p>
               <p>Generally he aſſaults by ſurpriſe, and takes the advantage of time, and place, as when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had faſted forty daies, and forty nights, and was hungry, and in the wilderneſs where was no relief, he tempts him to make bread of ſtones. He will not ſuffer them to conſider the danger, nor mind the cure, till it be late, and then he perſwades them, it is too late or incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>When ever he makes uſe of Scripture, he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrues it, and miſapplyeth it.</p>
               <p>By ſmall and imperceptible degrees he draws us to greater and greater. When he hath made his way by one ſin, or one degree in a ſin,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34461:49"/>he argues, this is no more than that we have already done; therefore why may we not do it now, as heretofore? That he may not deceive thee by this fallacy, make a covenant with all thy ſenſes, and look not upon that which tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth, nor harken to it.</p>
               <p>Another fallacy of Satan is, that he preſwades ſome that they do not ſin, unleſs they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the expreſs letter of the Commandment. The Fornicator he makes believe that ſimple Fornication is not forbid in the ſeventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, for that forbids adultery. So the covetous, he makes believe that he is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the condemnation of the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though he worſhips <hi>Mammon</hi> in his heart. It is but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which he gives his goddeſs. And likewiſe the Papiſts when they pray to the Bleſſed Virgin and other Saints. And when they fall down to the hoſt, or any thing elſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in lieu thereof by the knaviſh bearer, they pretend they worſhip not Idols, but yet in their catechiſes they have left out that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſplit the tenth Commandment in two to make up the number.</p>
               <p>Another deceit is in miſvaluing time whereby he ſteals away the preſent opportunity, and by anon and to morrow he puts off from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Idleneſs and delayes are pernicious, moſt of Satans Fallacies may be urged againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the reaſoning of the unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, becauſe he knew his Maſter to be a hard man, he hid his Talent in a Napkin, it was more ſtrongly urged againſt him. For he ought ſo much the more to have improved it. This way of refelling him is like the cutting off <hi>Geliahs</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:34461:50"/>head with his own ſword. When he makes uſe of his faireſt Inſinuators, be not aſhamed of rudeneſs to them. Thou mayeſt anſwer all his ſuggeſtions with a <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> as our Saviour did. This ſword of the ſpirit cuts all Satans ſnares aſunder. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> cut them aſunder ſaying, How can I do this and ſin? He would not ſo much as hearken to the fair tempter, nor be with her; when ſhe laid hold of him, he fled from her without a complement. So muſt we keep Satan at ſwords point, for if we ſuffer him to come within it, we loſe our guard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non ſic retribuam Domino,</hi> may be anſwered to all. <hi>Non ſic Patri, Adjutori, Salvatori,</hi> conſider the many pleaſures, comforts and enjoyments which the Lord allows thee to ſollace thy ſelf withall, how free, how pure, how ſatisfying, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are; and compare them with thoſe which are offered by Satan, and ſee how thy exceed them in goodneſs. For theſe which Satan tempts thee to are allayed ſo with bitterneſs, that the very ſweetneſs is turned into bitterneſs, the Hony into Gall: The damnable alloy (which I mean) is the gripes of conſcience in the very act of enjoying them, and the flaſhes of Hell fire as oft as they come into memory, expreſſed by that of the Poet, <hi>Et coeco verbere pulſat;</hi> That is, they are ſlaſhed by their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Alſo the detrement which theſe bring to the body, eſtate, and good name. Why then ſhould'ſt thou not chuſe to enjoy thoſe which God hath given thee as a loving Father, and be ſatisfied and content therewith, rather than be licoriſh for ſuch filthy ſweet poiſons?</p>
               <p>Conſider, that every wilful ſin puts thee out of God's protection.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:34461:50"/>
               <p>He pretends that our good works can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not further our ſalvation, nor our evil works hinder it; thereupon he infers, that it is to no purpoſe to ſtrive to enter into the ſtrait gate, and to wreſtle with our corruptions, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did. But yet we muſt believe that God will reward them that diligently ſeek him, though we are unprofitable ſervants.</p>
               <p>If thou knoweſt that this or that is a trap ſet to catch a fool, if thou wilt come into it, what art thou? But if thou wilt be wiſe, do that which thou knoweſt thou ſhalt never wiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
               <p>In ſecular concerns we ſeldom will cloſe with the firſt overtures, if it be a matter of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, but we deſire time. In like ſort let us put off the firſt proffers of our luſts, and we ſhall never be ſurprized, and the ſecond aſſault will be weaker, and we ſhall be prepared better to reſiſt them.</p>
               <p>That thou mayeſt the better ſlight the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of thy ſpiritual enemy, conſider how they offer themſelves ſervily, and if thou wilt not go out of thy doors to fetch them, they will come home to thee.</p>
               <p>He ſuggeſts to men deſtitute and afflicted, What profit haſt thou of thy righteouſneſs more than if thou hadſt ſinned? <hi>Job</hi> 35. To this the anſwer is, That <hi>no man ever ſerved God for nought;</hi> a cup of cold water for his ſake hath its reward; and <hi>Jehu</hi>'s hypocritical ſervice was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to the fourth generation.</p>
               <p>Let the love which thou beareſt to God and Jeſus Chriſt, repreſs all oppoſite rival Loves, <hi>viz.</hi> to the objects of ſenſe and fancies; ſuch as are the <hi>Syrens</hi> voices.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:34461:51"/>
               <p>He puts the opportunity into the hand, and then ſuggeſts, that they ſhall never have ſo good an opportunity, unleſs immediately they lay hold on this: If he can but perſwade thee of this, he hath already overcome thee.</p>
               <p>He endeavours to perſwade us, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent will not bite; but be not thou ſo ſilly as to truſt him. But if when thou beholdeſt a horſe that is given to be skittiſh, and to ſtrike; and becauſe he is of curious ſhape, and of a good courage, and pleaſeth the eye, thou muſt needs be ſtroaking him; thou wilt find (to thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row) that he will not be ſenſible of thy kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And ſuch are all ſinful allurements: Therefore conſider their nature, and not their appearance, and withhold thy hand from fond ſtroaking them.</p>
               <p>And if there be any thing lovely in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that allures thee, conſider alſo that there is as much deformity and loathſomneſs mixed with it, and covered under that skin deep beauty.</p>
               <p>If thou haſt been deceived, and haſt rued thy ſollies, and repented and vowed againſt them, do not again build that which thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and return to thy vomit; but ſay of thy luſts, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> of his Idols, <hi>What have I to do with them?</hi> For what hath the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do with the old man? the regenerate with unclean luſts? the holy with corrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication? the mortified with carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and concupiſcence? the humble with pride? the charitable with malice and revenge? Thou fighteſt not under the ſame banner, but under the Captain of thy ſalvation Jeſus Chriſt; do
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34461:51"/>not betray thy Party, thy Captain, and thy Cauſe Do not go to be drunk in thine enemies Camp; nor ſleep there, leſt he ſpoil thee of all thou haſt; or take away thy life, or make thee his priſoner. Remember that thou art running a race, ſtoop not to catch the golden ball that Satan throws in thy way, to make thee loſe the race. By Patient continuance in well doing thou ſeekeſt glory; let go thy luſts.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſnares and baits of Satan, are to be ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died of thoſe who are ſworn to fight againſt them, that they may be able to refel, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them; and in reſpect of our weakneſs to do it, we muſt crave God's aſſiſtance, who hath promiſed it, in many promiſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.24. <hi>They that have erred in ſpirit, ſhall come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, &amp;c. v.</hi> 18. <hi>The deaf ſhall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind ſhall ſee out of obſcurity. No weapon formed againſt thee ſhall proſper. They ſhall be all taught of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He promiſeth to watch over them, and keep them night and day, leſt any hurt them; and to help them, ſtrengthen them, ſuſtain and hold them up with his right hand; to be with them, and never to leave nor forſake them; to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from evil; to tread Satan under our feet, that we ſhall bruiſe his head, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And in regard we know not in what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occurrences of our lives, or in which occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the day, our ſpiritual adverſary hath laid his ſhares to catch our ſouls, whether in our religious ſervices, or in our natural actions of eating, drinking, or ſleeping, or apparel. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from our Relations, Servants, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours or Enemies; or a ſtranger met upon the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34461:52"/>way, or hapening into our company, or from our own infirmities of body or mind; from our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, or from our recreations; yet in all we know there is danger, if God keep us not, guide us and direct our waies, and gives an iſſue to the temptation. Therefore we ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in ſeeking God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. believing that he will reward them that diligently ſeek him, keep them, watch over them, guard them, guide them, defend them, ſtand by them; and be a Sun and a Shield to them.</p>
               <p>And though we pray, <hi>Lead us not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> yet certainly we muſt be tempted; for then only can vertue ſhew it ſelf, when we are tempted to vice. To talk of vertue, and to do many vertuous actions gladly, juſt then when we come from a lecture of vertue, may be no vertue; for many have done ſo as well as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and <hi>Felix.</hi> But to live holily, righteouſly and uprightly in the midſt of a wicked genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, grieving his righteous ſoul with behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their unclean converſation, as <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> did live, ſheweth their vertues to be true gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For inſtance, of her that was never tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to unchaſtity, we ſay, <hi>caſta eſt quia nemo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavit.</hi> So of Monks, Friers, Eremites, Nuns, and the like of that Religion, who are retired from the ſociety of men, and from temptations, what temptations can try them?</p>
               <p>Though I, and many others are not ſtrong enough to count it joy when we fall into temptations, as St. <hi>James</hi> bids us in the caſe of the temptations of affliction; and therefore we pray that we be not lead into them. Yet when we have been in temptations, and have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34461:52"/>them, we have had much joy in the ſenſe of our grace whereby we have overcome, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were temperance, patience, charity, or any other grace, and we could ſay the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was for our good.</p>

                  <head>Motives to the Duty of Prayer.</head>
                  <p>Being ſenſible of the dulneſs and indiſpoſition of my ſoul to this religious and moſt neceſſary duty of a Chriſtian, and deſirous by all means to ſhake it off for a better diſpoſition, I held it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to conſider of ſome Motives, which may awaken me out of this ſpiritual Lethargy.</p>
                  <p>Theſe I fetch from four heads or Topicks, <hi>viz. A Jucundo, Ab <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tili, A Neceſſario,</hi> and <hi>A Facili.</hi> The four Angels of this Quadrature, are to ſeek him as a Beloved, as a Portion, as a God, as a Father. To prove the pleaſurableneſs of it are theſe places, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.3. <hi>With joy ſhall ye draw water out of the wells of ſalvation, Joh.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Ask that you may receive, that your Joy may be full;</hi> and many of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and the Book of the <hi>Canticles</hi> throughout proves this: From whence we may infer, That the more we uſe this duty, the more joy, comfort and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction we enjoy. <hi>I will make them joyful in the houſe of Prayer.</hi> He that with a ſincere heart hath made tryal in the time of his ſadneſs, can teſtifie the truth of theſe promiſes by his own experience. And the Scripture teſtifieth of <hi>Hannah,</hi> That when ſhe had prayed her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was no more ſad.</p>
                  <p>To know God in all his Attributes is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to his ſervants; but of all, to know him
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34461:53"/>in this, That he is a God hearing Prayer, and hath heard thine, is moſt ſoveraign for the warming and ſtrengthening of thy faith, and all other graces, and quickening thee in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. One prayer heard is the earneſt of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another, and conſequently of helping thee in all thy needs.</p>
                  <p>This is intimated in thoſe expreſſions, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Go thy way, cat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for the Lord hath accepted thy work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if theſe ſervices be God's delight, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they ſhould be our burthen, or a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly task. This cannot be; no man was ever made ſad by this duty; but the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly are made cheerful by it alwaies, and tranſported with joy. And if they be accepted by him with delight, then we know that they ſhall not go unrewarded. The ſuits of a Lover to its Beloved, how readily are they embraced and anſwered? Such is relation between God and his Saints.</p>
                  <p>We know alſo how acceptable and delightful the ſervice of a child is to his Father; though it be but weak and ſmall, yet it is ſweet, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful; and doth more endear them to one another; and when children are wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whom elſe ſhould they fly unto for ſuccour? Herein we enjoy God as a loving Father in Chriſt, and he enjoyes us as children, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes us.</p>
                  <p>This urgeth us to preſent theſe duties; for we endeavour that our preſents and ſervices we do to men, ſhould yield them delight; for thereby we expect acceptation of our perſons,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34461:53"/>and a grant of our ſuit. And as a Father, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us to it, by his lading us with his daily benefits. <hi>And bearing us in his arms (as a man beareth his Son) in all the way that we ge, Deut.</hi> 1.31.

And by theſe the Utility of the due peformance of this Duty appeareth. And all thoſe who have made trial in ſincerity, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that it is good to draw nigh to God.</p>
                  <p>If we know that in him we live, move, and have our being; that he is God that made us,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34461:54"/>and preſerves us, and upholds all things by his power; then to him we will ſeek for all things neceſſary for our life and happineſs, becauſe we know, that what we have, or deſire to have, we muſt have it from him, of his free gift. And knowing that we brought nothing into the world, we muſt acknowledge, that all we have, we have it from him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if we deſire the continuance and preſervation of that we have, or ſeek any other good, we muſt ſeek it by humble prayer and ſupplication of his free mercy and goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>This the Light of Nature teacheth: Thoſe who ſeem to themſelves to be rich, and to have need of nothing (like the Church of the <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans, Rev.</hi> 2.) do but deceive themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Theſe miſerable wretches cannot perceive or underſtand what need they have of praying. They have the more need, becauſe they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not their need. If the Thief upon the Croſs obtained Heaven with a prayer of ſix words, who will not come to ſuch a liberal giver? If we conſider of God in his relation to us as a Father, and our ſelves, as his children; we can have no ſtronger motive than this, to draw us to ſeek all good things we ſtand in need of from him.</p>
                  <p>For if we can by faith in Jeſus Chriſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this relation, how can we doubt of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things we ask, and ſtand in need of? for we muſt needs know his love to be great to us, if we find a reciprocal love towards him.</p>
                  <p>And although we be prodigals, and but of little faith, our bleſſed Saviour tells us, that yet we are children, and under his care.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:34461:55"/>
                  <p>And this argument he makes uſe of to invite us to come to God in prayer; the force of Nature muſt needs be ſtrongeſt in him, who made Nature. The motives which excite him, muſt needs be ſtronger and greater than thoſe which excite us, as he is greater.</p>
                  <p>And he makes uſe of the argument to thoſe who are evil (<hi>If you being evil, know,</hi> &amp;c.) To prove that God will give his Spirit to them, if they ask it, though before they had received the Spirit of Chriſt, they were none of Gods children by adoption; for this is given by Chriſt, to thoſe only who believe in his name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p>Between God, and his adopted children there is a double Relation of paternity. That citation in the Acts of the Apoſtles out of the Poet <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that we are Gods off-ſpring, doth relate to the general relation whereby God is the Father of all man-kind as he was <hi>Adams:</hi> So <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Natural Father of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But the Relation by faith between God, and us, and <hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> is the only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Relation.</p>
                  <p>By the firſt Relation, we do know, that we muſt worſhip God, and pray to him, and we may hope to prevail but by the ſecond we are ſure to ſpeed, we have boldneſs and title to all the promiſes, and acceſs with confidence to the throne of grace.</p>
                  <p>The motives from neceſſity are of two ſorts: The firſt are fetched from the neceſſity of the abſolute Command of God laid upon us. The ſecond from our own needs and neceſſities which preſs us to it.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:34461:55"/>
                  <p>Thoſe commands already mentioned in the precedent motives, may be reſorted to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repeting them. <hi>In every thing let your requeſts be made known to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This duty in many places is perſwaded to us with gracious promiſes, rather than comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; which manifeſts the Infinite goodneſs of almighty God, thus to draw us to our duty with the cords of love, as in the precedent heads.</p>
                  <p>Here follows ſome abſolute commands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging us to it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. <hi>I will be cried after. Jer. I will be called upon.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Watch unto prayer.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 5. <hi>Pray without ceaſing. Continuing in ſtant in prayer. Praying alwaies with all manner of prayer and ſupplication.</hi> 10. <hi>Zac.</hi> 1. <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.6. And pray. Our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Lord and Saviour joynes to the precept, the ſtrongeſt argument to inforce it that can be conceived, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13. He propoundeth and promiſeth for our reward, whatſoever we ask; the like, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.7.</p>
                  <p>And as the uſe of this duty gaineth us every thing: ſo was it the uſe of this that firſt gained us an intereſt in God as to our feeling; and the more frequent uſe of it we make, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt we gain in him; and again, diſuſage of this loſeth the ſenſe of our intreſt in God and Chriſt, and this is the finding promiſed; ſuch ſhall know God and them ſelves to have intereſt in him.</p>
                  <p>The motive which moſt ſtrongly forceth us to this duty whether we will or no, is our own wants which force us to ſeek to him as our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells how, that in the ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> army paſſing over a lake
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34461:56"/>that was frozen, the Ice began to crack, and the whole army together fell down upon their knees, and prayed. The Mareners that were in the ſhip with <hi>Jona</hi> in the Tempeſt, did the like. So <hi>David</hi> ſhews in the 107 <hi>Pſal.</hi> How people afflicted with all miſeries for their ſins, when they are at deaths door, call upon the Lord in their trouble, and are delivered; for he ſaith in another <hi>Pſalm, The Lord is known as a ſure refuge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore find out our needs for ſoul and body; for they are ſent for this purpoſe, to move us to reſort to God in this duty, which for lack of the ſenſe of them is often neglected. And we forget our Creator, and our dependance upon him, till by the rod upon our backs, we are made to hear him that hath appointed it, and to ſeek to him, as our God, our Rock, our Caſtle, our Buckler, the horn of our ſalvation, and our preſent help.</p>
                  <p>Generally. Firſt, conſider the ſlipry, eſtate of thy youth wherein thou ſtandeſt environed with daily temptations, and dangers, through which of thy ſelf thou art not able to paſs without many falls: man knoweth not how to walk, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This conſideration will move thee to ſeek to him to be guide of thy youth, who only can guide thee, and hath promiſed to guide thee continually, and to keep thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.17. <hi>I am the Lord which teacheth thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee by the way that thou ſhouldeſt go, Pſal.</hi> 25.22. Thy ſoul will hang on him if thou conſider that his right hand upholdeth thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.8.</p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:34461:56"/>
                  <p>Confider what is in thy heart naturally, what thoughts and Imaginations come ſpontaneouſly into thy mind; are they holy thoughts, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſtir, and are fomented at ſuch times as this duty is either wilfully neglected, or through much buſineſs omitted; or are they vain, worldly, profane and ſinful? if theſe be; then be careful, that when thou awakeſt thou be preſent with God, and let thy ſoul inſtantly fly unto him. And ſeek him early in thoſe words of <hi>David</hi> in the 63 <hi>Pſal.</hi> througout. <hi>O God thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee,</hi> &amp;c. Or in the like words, and <hi>Let thy ſoul fly unto him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the morning watch, Pſal.</hi> And continue ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ever more.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe that know God, as theires; their Intereſt in him, gives them this boldneſs of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in all occaſions. And if any ſeek him not early, they doubt of their intereſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in him. Or of their needs; for we are not afraid to loſe that we never had, nor deſire to have; neither do we think we can make uſe of that which neither owneth us, nor we own that.</p>
                  <p>That which we ſeek early, conſtantly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitouſly, is that which we know we need and live upon, and cannot live without. Therefore thus ſeek thy God; and thus ſhew thy careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to preſerve thine Intereſt in him, and to improve it, and to make uſe of it at all times; and to acknowledge him in all thy waies, in thy outward bleſſings and preſervations, and inward gifts, and graces, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thou that art at thy beſt as <hi>Adam</hi> was, thou muſt needs know thy mutability and inſtability,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34461:57"/>and that thou alſo (though ſtrong) art in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling at all times, and in all places as he fell. And the Rock it ſelf, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> fell, and <hi>David</hi> by ſlender temptations. Therefore let not thy many graces, and perfections cauſe thee to overlook, thy inſufficiency, or deſpiſe the ſtrength, and ſubtilty of thine adverſary who is compared to a roaring Lion, but contninue thou inſtant in this duty, and watch leſt thou fall as they did. And as <hi>Moſes, Noah, Lot,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and other Saints have fallen. Bleſſed is he that feareth alwaies. If when we would do good evil is preſent with us, much more is it preſent when we are about ſecular affairs.</p>
                  <p>And further, Thou that art throughly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, conſider what need thy graces have of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual watering, that they may not wither, nor decay; for God (who beſts knows our needs) would not have promiſed to water us every morning, and every moment, were there no need; but becauſe it is neceſſary, he promiſed it, and we are to beg, that he would water us with his own teaching, with his word, and new dictates of the Spirit. And make our ſoul as a watered Garden. And a Garden incloſed, and a Fountain ſealed, that no polluting thing may come into it, to defile it; and that he would quicken us in his ſtatutes, ſo that all men may be convinced of their neceſſity, and thereby be moved to the performance of this ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſo profitable, and delightful a duty. And to ſeek his face and his grace evermore, and to be alwaies upon our knees at the throne of grace when we can: other neceſſities there are which may move us daily to the duty, as
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34461:57"/>namely the burden of thoſe ſins which lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our conſciences, which whoſoever hath felt, knoweth how preſſing it is, and of how great importance the eaſement will be to his ſoul, that God would ſpeak peace to it. And ſay to his ſoul, that he is his ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>This guilt doth ſometimes lye feſtering in the ſoul, and doth not diſquiet at all, but woful is the ſtate of it then. He that is moſt ſpeedy in his repentance, will moſt eaſily find it; as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when he had ſinned in denying his Lord and Maſter, immediately went out, and wept bitterly. But <hi>David,</hi> who lay in his guilt, found it a ſore burthen, too heavy for him to bear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. And was almoſt conſumed by means of God's heavy hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.11. His chaſtiſements made his beauty to conſume away like as it were a moth fretting a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this brings him to confeſs his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and be ſorry for his ſins, <hi>ib. Pſal.</hi> 38.18. and to pray to God to help him, <hi>v.</hi> 22. And God healeth him in his own time. Though he ſuffer him long to lye under the burden, that he may fear to commit the like again. And that ſeeing his own ſinfulneſs and unrighteouſneſs, he may ſeek his righteouſneſs out of himſelf in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>How many ſudden and unexpected provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and temptations do hurry men into the greateſt ſins that ever they committed in their lives? as this of the matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi> So that we muſt fear alwaies, and watch, and pray to God to keep us, and work in us both the will and the deed that is good.</p>
                  <p>How many ſad and unexpected accidents do
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34461:58"/>we ſee daily befalling other men, as good, as wiſe, as ſtrong, and as wealthy as our ſelves; ſome by fire, ſome by water, ſome by ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack. All the four elements by which we live; and the very meat we eat, and the drink we drink, bring ſudden and unexpected death and deſtruction upon unprepared and ſecure mortals. Sometimes a Tyle falls upon their head, of which death is cauſed: ſometimes they ſtumble, and falling, break a bone, and ſo death cometh. And a thouſand waies more which no mans wiſdom and ſtrength can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee nor prevent.</p>
                  <p>All which, when we ſee them to befal others, we know they might as well have befallen our ſelves, if God did not keep us, and deliver us from all evil; and we muſt acknowledge with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 41. <hi>Thou upholdeſt me in health.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, that he would be pleaſed ſo to do, we call upon him, as it is meet and neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Conſider whether this be not the end and purpoſe for which God ſuffers them to befal men; for ſo it is intimated in that place of the Prophet. <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> For God complains there how they had ſinned and provoked him, and had forſaken him; but he would have them return by this means.</p>
                  <p>And this is intimated likewiſe from that of <hi>Daniel, c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>All this evil is come upon us, yet made we not our prayers before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our iniquities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whoſoever hath been brought to extremity, and found no means in himſelf to eſcape, he knows this to be his refuge. And if he hath obtained his deliverance at the hand of God,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34461:58"/>and ſhall afterwards forget, or neglect his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, he can ill expect that the Lord will be found of him at his time of need afterwards. But this is too frequently done, as it was by the rebellious <hi>Jews, Iſa.</hi> 63.16. There they come, ſaying, <hi>Doubtleſs thou art our Father;</hi> but when God ſhall ſhake them off, and ſay unto them, as he ſaid to them; <hi>If I be a Father, where is my honour?</hi> certainly they will be put to ſhame, and ſilence, and confuſion of face.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may take occaſion to conſider the miſerable and helpleſs condition of thoſe who wholly neglect this duty; and will only pray in their extremity: Their own conſciences (it is to be feared) will accuſe them, and tell them, that they are of their Father the Devil; and probably they will then ſeek to him too. As <hi>Saul</hi> did when the Lord had forſaken him; and the Lord may ſend them to their luſts which they have ſerved.</p>
                  <p>But what ſpiritual extremities are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God often brought to, when the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of Satan are ſent to buſſet them, (as the beſt may fear they may be.) And when theſe and the outward troubles concur to make up a fiery trial, (ſuch as the holy Apoſtles experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced many times, as they teſtifie, <hi>viz. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out were troubles, and within were fears;</hi> and in many other parallel places is teſtified) how are they put to it, when Satan thus bruiſeth their heel, and they are afraid that he will bruiſe their head alſo? becauſe they ſeel no power in themſelves for the preſent to bruiſe his with the two-edged ſword of the Word. When they find by experience, That the Righteous ſhall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34461:59"/>ſcarcely be ſaved; That the way to Heaven is narrow, and found but of few; The Devil like a roaring Lion rageth to devour them, and they ſee not thoſe that are for them, and how ſtrong and many they are; and God hides his face, and the light of his countenance, and makes them as his enemies, and ſeems to have forſaken them; and though they have called long, he hears not; and their diſtracting griefs and pains are ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they cannot conſider of the daies of the right hand of the Moſt High.</p>
                  <p>Let theſe conſiderations enter into our hearts; for if our caſe may happen to be ſuch, then let us be ſenſible of our dangerous condition we are in, or ſoon may be; and we ſhall ſeek in time for ſtrength, ſupportation, preſervation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from him who hath promiſed to be with us in trouble, and never to leave nor to forſake us; And to keep us, to guide, help, and deliver us, and bring us to honour; And not to ſuffer our feet to be moved. Oh when ſhall it once be (O Lord) that thou wilt tread Satan under our feet, &amp; make us more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour over him. We cannot be enough ſenſible of our ſpiritual dangers of our immortal ſouls.</p>
                  <p>The frequent admonitions of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to watchfulneſs, ſelf-denial, prayer, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, and other means to be uſed by us, that we may be able to ſtand, ſhew us how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a thing it is; and God ſuffereth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſometimes to be brought to the higheſt top of the precipice, and then plucks them as brands out of the fire of Hell; that they may ſee their danger: for unleſs they do ſee and know their danger, they will be but cold in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34461:59"/>prayer, and ſuch prayers can never prevail, or obtain any promiſe, <hi>Quid quiſque vitet nun quam homini ſatis, Cautum eſt in horas.</hi> Horat.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe who are ſenſible thereof, will be fervent and frequent in prayer to God; and they will take Heaven by force. If they can by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and affiduity, they will obtain of God the ſame anſwer that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſufficiency of grace, and in their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he will perfect his own ſtrength; but if they had ſufficiency of gifts and parts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer temptations, they would not know that God doth it, nor ſeek him, nor depend on him.</p>
                  <p>Let us not imagine that ſuch dangers and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties rarely befal the people of God. When Jeſus Chriſt tells his Diſciples, that through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tribulations they muſt go to Heaven; They muſt be hated of the World; That in the World they muſt have trouble; Men ſhall ſay all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evil of them falſly for his ſake, and pronounceth a bleſſing upon ſuch ſufferers. If we will come after him, we muſt deny our ſelves, and take up our Croſs. So the Apoſtle, That <hi>we have need of patience, that when we have done Gods will, we may inherit the promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And they of their own experience teſtifie that they found the truth of his ſayings. <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>My ſoul is alwaies in mine hand. From my youth up thy terrours have I ſuffered with a troubled mind. All the day long have I been afflicted, and chaſtened every morning.</hi> And <hi>the pains of Hell came about me, the ſnares of death overtook me. I am troubled above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>If my delight had not been in thy Law, it had not failed, but I had periſhed in my
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34461:60"/>troubles. My tears have been my meat day and night.</hi> Shall we then expect to go to Heaven upon any eaſier terms? nay but we muſt wade thorough with the ſame ſtaff of comfort. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what difficulties God's children do find in every good work, and what oppoſition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary principles. When they would do good evil is preſent with them. What great neceſſity then have they of this duty? Thoſe things which are hurtful to our bodies, we can eaſily leave them, but not ſo the things which are hurtful to our ſouls, though we are mortified, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, by keeping under our body, and renewed in our hearts by the Spirit. Be ſenſible then of theſe difficulties, as the Apoſtle was, and of thy remaining corruptions, and thou wilt cry to God with importunity, as he did, and watch againſt thy ſpiritual adverſary, and thou ſhalt have cauſe alſo, with him, to glory in God through Jeſus Chriſt. Look upon temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as fire, and thy corrupt nature as the gunpowder.</p>
                  <p>Alſo thoſe who by their own experience can affirm, that they have called upon the Lord in their trouble, and he hath delivered them out of their diſtreſs, and ſaved them and delivered them from all their fears; and that by him they have been unholden ever ſince they were born. That he hath been to them a preſent help in trouble. That he hath ever ſtood by them, ſaved them, and delivered them. Hath never left them, nor forſaken them. That he hath known their ſoul in adverſity. That he hath been their helper. That in the multitude of the ſorrows of their heart, his comforts have refreſhed their ſouls.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34461:60"/>And thoſe whoſe conſcience beareth witneſs to them of their ſincerity and uprightneſs, as <hi>Job</hi>'s did, <hi>Job</hi> 31. <hi>ch.</hi> throughout. And know that their Nature is renewed by their quickneſs in the actions of grace when they are tempted to ſin; even theſe are ſometimes diſmayed and caſt down, as <hi>David</hi> expreſſed it in this ſaying; <hi>ſc. Pſal. Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled,</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> 13. <hi>Wherefore hideſt thou thy face?</hi> But if the Lord doth ſhew the light of his countenance upon them, and his preſence go with them, then they can rely upon the Truth of God's promiſes, in the valley of the ſhadow of death, in the midſt of the fiery furnace, and in the Lion's den; and though he ſhould kill them, they will truſt in him. And they can praiſe him when he takes away, as well as when he gives, and pray unto him. But our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his Truth, and our own purpoſes, vows, and reſolutionns, and watching, without his preſence, his ſupportation, and the light of his countenance, will not be ſufficient to bear us up in the fiery tryal, no more than it did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the other Saints; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath promiſed to be with us in it. In the ſire he will be with us, that it ſhall not burn us; and in the water, that it ſhall not drown us; and ſo he was with <hi>Job,</hi> though he hid his face, and ſeem'd his enemy. <hi>The ſpirit of a man can bear his infirmities, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear? Pſal.</hi> 42.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations teach us how great need and neceſſity all men have of diligence in this duty; conſider alſo whether it be not meet and neceſſary for the children of God to ſeek thoſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34461:61"/>priviledges which Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for them, by this duty of prayer. Becauſe our Bleſſed Saviour did thus ſeek his priviledges and birthright as God appointed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus the children of God do ask for, and beg their rights, and priviledges, through the name, merit, and meditation of Jeſus Chriſt by the Spirits aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>As the Lord taught them to do.</p>
                  <p>As in that particular priviledge of putting the Spirit into them, promiſed by God in the new Covenant. Chriſt Jeſus commands them to ask it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore they ought alſo to pray, that God would tread Satan under their feet. That he would deliver them from every evil work, that he would keep them night, and day, watch over them. Be a Sun, and a ſhield to them, a wall of fire about them; and ſo for the reſt of their priviledges.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the precedent Motives, and many more which might be alledged, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the examples of thoſe who have practiſed this duty with ſucceſs; ſome few we will here inſert.</p>
                  <p>As, <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt, when his hands were lifted up, <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed againſt their enemies in battle; when they were down, the <hi>Amalakites</hi> prevailed againſt them. One pair of hands lifted up to Heaven in prayer, prevailed more than many Thouſands that were lifted up in battle. <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:34461:61"/>recounts ſeveral ſuch gracious diſpenſations of God towards him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.19. and 10.10. <hi>He fell down before the Lord forty daies and forty nights, and the Lord hearkned unto him, ver.</hi> 25. <hi>He fell down again before the Lord forty daies and forty nights when the Lord would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them, and</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>v. And the Lord harkned unto him at that time alſo. And the Lord would not deſtroy them. Exod.</hi> 32.10. The like. Many times would the Lord have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them, had not <hi>Moſes</hi> put up his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. The fire conſumed the people, and <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, and it wa quenched.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phineas,</hi> when Gods wrath was hot againſt this people to deſtroy them with the plague, prayed, and ſo the plague ceaſed.</p>
                  <p>How often did he yeild to <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayer for ſparying <hi>Sodom?</hi> ſo often that <hi>Abraham,</hi> was aſhamed to urge him any further. And <hi>Samuel</hi> is among ſuch as called upon his name, and he heard them, and while <hi>Daniel</hi> was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prayer he obtained his ſuit.</p>

                     <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.4. <hi>I ſought the Lord and he heard me, and deliverd me out of all my fear.</hi> And in divers other Pſalms he teſtifieth the ſame; and <hi>Jehoſophat</hi> when he knew not what to do againſt the great hoſt of his enemies, prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by prayer 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. Which examples and many more the ſcripture ſets forth to ſhew how prevalent, acceptable, and delightful this ſervice is to God, and to excite us to it with boldneſs and confidence, as the Apoſtle makes uſe of the example of <hi>Elias,</hi> who by prayer opened and ſhut the Heavens, for this purpoſe to excite us to the duty, for though there be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34461:62"/>paſſions, and infirmities in us, and our ſervices be but weak, yet God looks upon us, as a tender parent looks upon his child, and pittieth, and pardoneth the defects, in regard of the willingneſs of the obedience, and receives our ſervices with delight, becauſe he ſeeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf in us, and ſo he is loth to deny any thing. God was not offended with <hi>Iſaiah</hi> when to ſatisfy one man he required that the Sun ſhould go back. And ſo loath is God that any prayer ſhould be put up to him in vain without ſucceſs, that he wills us not to pray for ſuch things as he intends not to grant. When <hi>Samuel</hi> prayed for <hi>Saul; How long</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wilt thou pray for Saul ſince I have rejected him?</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.4. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.15.16. <hi>I will caſt them out of my ſight, therefore pray not for this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, neither make interceſſion for them, for I will not hear thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſhall we then think of the ſtrength of prayer?</p>
                  <p>It ſeemes to hold Gods hands that he can not do what he would, for <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.13. Before cited God ſaith to <hi>Moſes: I have ſeen this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they are a ſtiff-necked people, Let me alone that I may deſtroy them, Exod.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Moſes</hi> would not let him alone, and God hearkned unto him, and did not deſtroy them. So that it was as <hi>Moſes</hi> would.</p>
                  <p>O omnipotent prayer that thus prevaileſt with the almighty! O invincible, and all conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring believer that canſt wraſtle with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and prevail (as <hi>Jacob</hi> did!) that canſt hold him ſo faſt, that he cannot go, unleſs thou pleaſe to let him, elſe why doth he ſay, let me
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34461:62"/>go? and <hi>Jacob</hi> anſwered, I will not unleſs thou bleſs me; and he did bleſs him. <hi>Jacob</hi> got what he would of him, before he would let him go; ſo God ſuffered himſelf to be overcome.</p>
                  <p>In like ſort when the ſentence of Death was gone out againſt <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> his prayer cauſed God to change it.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, he is not only overcome, but commanded by prayer (underſtand it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11. Concerning the works of my hands, command you me; accordingly we find <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpeaking, <hi>Sun, ſtand thou ſtill in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon, and thou Moon in Ajalon. Joſh.</hi> 10.12. <hi>And they ſtood ſtill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We read how prayer changed nature, altering the property of fire that it neither burned nor ſcorched the 3 children, ſtopped the mouths of the Lions, whereby we ſee how that by means of this, we may be ſafe in any place, and God will be with us, and nothing ſhall be able to hurt us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.15. <hi>He ſhall call upon me, and I will anſwer him;</hi> It hath no limitation of matter, or reſtriction of time, or place, ſo that we need not diſpair of any thing we ask.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary alſo that we pray for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Propheſies thereof, <hi>Mala.</hi> 1.11. <hi>In every place incenſe ſhall be offered unto my Name,</hi> and a pure offering, the <hi>epis</hi> of.

The Spirit of prayer and ſupplication is in ſtead of the legal Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>If the people of God have ſuch holy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites as they expreſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34461:63"/>Hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo longeth my ſoul after thee, O God. My ſoul is a thirſt for God,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for thee. My fleſh alſo longeth after thee.</hi> And in <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah, With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night,</hi> and in the <hi>Canticles</hi> throughout, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth, for his love is better than wine.</hi> (The ſoul is kiſſed by Chriſt when it is aſſured of his love to it, and of its own love to Chriſt, and the Heavenly ſpouſe, her deſire is to her beloved as is the wives to her husband. And is as unſatiable in her deſires as the greedy Uſerer is for riches.)</p>
                  <p>Then muſt they needs ſeek him whom their ſoul loveth, and deſireth, and longeth for, in this, and in all other ordinances, as the ſpouſe expreſſeth her ſolicitouſneſs, and vigilancy, in the ſeeking and perſuit of him. That they may relieve their needs, and ſatisfy their ſpiritual thirſts, and hungers, and that they may miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and aſſwage their grief and pain, cauſed by the holy love-ſickneſs; for if they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by occaſion of buſineſs extraordinary to omit ſome duty, they cannot injoy themſelves, and then they long for thoſe ſpiritual refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which duties afford. There be two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal motives which make us frequent, and earneſt ſuitors at the Throne of grace, <hi>viz.</hi> Deſire of communion with God, and enjoyment of him in his ordinances. And deſire of more grace. And God doth moſt commonly ſatisfy theſe two deſires in this, &amp; in all other duties; for being wel performed from theſe two principles, they are our ſollaces and delight, and alſo Gods delight. Therefore will he hear them, and reward them.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34461:63"/>Albeit Gods holy people ask temporal bleſſings of him, and the comforts of their life, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral deliverances; ſo that it may be objected, that they have other principles, and motives natural of performing duties, than theſe two ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, that it is the diſpoſition of the New nature of the child of God to deſire the obtaining of temporal mercies, and bleſſings by and through this way, and meanes of ſeeking them of the gift of God by prayer only, that ſo they may enjoy them as pledges of his fatherly love, mercy and faithfulneſs, and as returnes of their prayers. And ſo they will be the more careful to uſe them to the honour, and glory of God. And in them they enjoy God, and his loving kindneſs, which they value, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves with, more than with his gifts, as it is expreſſed in the Pſalmes, in this ſaying, thy loveing kindneſs is better than the life it ſelf, and the heavenly Spouſe deſireth not to be inriched but by her husband; and for further anſwer I ſay, If God hath at any time heard us for outward bleſſings I conceive he hath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged us to ask them of him ſtill; as if I ſalute or viſit my neighbour and acquaintance, and he returnes the like civilities, I am to continue my compliſance, but if he anſwer them not, then he caſts me out.</p>
                  <p>Another Motive may be fetched from the Prieſtly office of Chriſt, who ever liveth to make interceſſion for us. And offereth up our prayers in his golden cenſer perfumed with incence, and ſweet odours. If ſo, then muſt we be careful, and make ſure, that he have our prayers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34461:64"/>to offer up for us, elſe we ſhall neglect him, and his office, and the acceſs with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which he hath purchaſed for us. Alſo we ſhall neglect the mercy of almighty God who is ſaid to be rich in mercy to all them that call upon him in <hi>Faith, Epheſ.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Alſo we ſhall neglect the gracious aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit which helpeth our infirmities in this duty.</p>
                  <p>Conſider alſo what Vows and promiſes we have made to God upon extraordinary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for the due performance of this duty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61.8. <hi>I will alwaies ſing praiſe unto thy name, that I may daily perform my vows, Pſal.</hi> 116.16. Conſider whether the facility of the duty be not a ſufficient Motive to it; for I conceive that there could not be made a more eaſie command than this of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Ask and ye ſhall have;</hi> Man could not have deſired an eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. It is expreſſed by <hi>David</hi> in his Pſalms thus, <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> To ask is the eaſieſt thing that we can do unleſs it be to open our mouthes. In this reſpect Chriſts burthen is light. The prayers which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins are ſhort; he forbids long ones. Beſides, the great rewards of ſo ſmall a ſervice make it yet lighter, becauſe of the diſproportion between this and that. And they are yet more light by reaſon of the aſſiſtance we have from Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit.</p>
                  <p>I intend not that all prayers are performed with eaſe alike. The fervent prayers of the Saints which are put up for ſuch graces as they need, and againſt ſuch luſts, temptations, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions &amp; trials as they labour under, are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34461:64"/>with ſighs, and groanes which cannot be uttered; but all their prayers are not ſuch, for thoſe which are but for common mercies ought not to be ſuch; for even the wickedeſt will pray and howl for Corn and Wine, as it is in <hi>Hoſe</hi> few words are injoined in theſe prayers. And thus they are moſt conſiſtent with faith in Gods promiſes, that he will not ſuffer us to want theſe Neceſſaries of life.</p>
                  <p>Compare theſe ſervices with the chargable Sacrifices of the Jewiſh law, and the burthen of ceremonies which they were not able to bear, and theſe will appeare but eaſie and light.</p>
                  <p>But that which facilitates this duty moſt, is faith, whereby believing we ſhall obtain we ask of God ſuch things as we need for our ſoul, and body, as confidently and boldly as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren uſe to ask of their parents the things they need, their food, and rayment, and the like: theſe eſteem it no difficulty to ask whatſoever they have a mind to, but a pleaſure and delight, and doubt not of ſpeeding, eſpecially when they are invited and incouraged by promiſes.</p>
                  <p>The freeneſs and eaſineſs of acceſs which we have to God in Chriſts name, makes the duty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; for Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God hath made way for the poor, and needy, and empty handed begger; they need not bring a preſent to make their way. But then when thou ſeeſt no good in thy ſelf, if thou (grieved thereat) deſireſt grace, and ſeekeſt to him for it, theſe are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives with which thy Saviour will be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to give thee of his fulneſs grace for grace, and will be moved thereby to intercede for
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34461:65"/>thee to his Father: what begger will not go thither for relief where he is aſſured to ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>The paternal relation between God and us, inſtructs us, of the eaſie acceſs; what ever we need we know he is ready as a Father to give; he takes care of us, and will provide for us, he expects but to be asked he hath prevented our asking with invitations, and will hardly ſtay till we have done asking, but he will grant it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he delighteth in granting the requeſts of his children, elſe he would not grant them with ſuch overplus, nor invite us to ask.</p>
                  <p>And it evidenceth to us that we are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when we do make uſe of our free acceſs upon all occaſions. And believe his readineſs to grant.</p>
                  <p>And if a prodigal Son might find ſuch free and kind reception, as our Saviour ſaith, then he that is the dear Son and pleaſent child, and hath title to all cannot be denied.</p>

Make us to feed by the Rivers of Waters, thy holy Ordinances, upon thy holy Word, and the Lord's Supper. That the weak may be as</hi> David, <hi>and the houſe of</hi> David <hi>as God. That thy willing people may be more and more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34461:68"/>that they may be zealous of good works, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies abounding in the work of the Lord, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their labour is not in vain in the Lord. Quicken and water the means of Grace. Make us able to mortifie our members more, and deny our ſelves more, to ſuffer loſſes, ſickneſſes and afflictions, more contentedly, willingly, and patiently, put a new edge upon thoſe motives which firſt moved us to forſake our luſts and the world, to embrace the love of God, and the fear of God, the knowledge of God. As the eyes of a ſervant are to the hands of his Maſter; and the eyes of a Maid to the hands of her Miſtreſs; ſo let our eyes be ever upon thee, for help, ſtrength, and direction. Give us the means of guarding and defending our ſelves againſt Satan. All the Armour of Light, the Shield of Faith; the Sword of the Spirit, the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, and for a Helmet, the Hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Teach us the Art of well uſing all theſe pieces of this ſpiritual Armour, both the defenſive, and the offenſive, that we may with them beat down every thought that exalteth it ſelf againſt God. Teach us all our military poſtures, that we may be able to ſtand. Watch thou over us, though we our ſelves watch too; and do thou keep us night and day, for thy promiſe ſake. Bear us in thy hand, as a man beareth his child. Go with us, never leave us nor forſake us. Make us to know thy will, and do it. Be thou our guide unto death. Direct thou our way, and order our ſteps in thy Word. Incline our heart that we may delight in thee. Deliver us from every evil work. Let no ſpiritual weapon formed againſt us proſper. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our bodies and ſouls blameleſs unto the coming of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34461:69"/>and make us able to overcome all our ſpiritual enemies.</hi>

                     <hi>Lord, whatever promiſes thou haſt made to us, thou madeſt them becauſe thou didſt deſire to give us the things promiſed. Thou only deſiredſt an opportunity from the receiver, or to be ſought to for them. We ſeek to thee according to thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; therefore let thy mercy which firſt moved thee to promiſe them, move thee now for thy Truths ſake to give them, as well all other thy promiſes, as theſe mentioned. And give us all thoſe mercies which thou haſt invited us to ask, or thy Son hath invited us to ſeek. Lord heal our blindneſs with thy eye-ſalve, which thou haſt invited the blind to ſeek of thee. And ſtrengthen our weak ſight more and more, that we may behold clearly the glory of the Lord, and may be changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, and may ſee the things of our eternal concernment. Relieve our nakedneſs with thoſe pure white Robes which thou haſt invited the naked to buy of thee, which will never be ſoiled, nor wax old. And relieve our poverty and penury with thy refined gold, which will inrich to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which thou expoſeſt to be ſold to the poor and needy, who have nothing to purchaſe it withall. Shew us wherwith we poor, blind and naked ſinners, ſhall purchaſe of thee theſe neceſſary ſupplies: For if we continue without them, we ſhall remain mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and periſh for lack of them. Lord, our raggs we are willing to part with for thoſe unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Robes; our wretched poverty for that refined gold; and our blind eyes for that clear and quick ſight which thy eye-ſalve will make in us; that we may be capable of ſeeing the remedies of our pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nakedneſs. Shew us how we may purchaſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34461:69"/>of thee wine and milk without money, and without price, to relieve our thirſty ſouls. Lord give us the thirſt and deſire of thoſe precious liquors, to ſatisfie our thirſts, and do thou ſatisfie our ſouls with thoſe Rivers of pleaſure which are at thy Right hand for evermore. And that we may lack no grace, and thy relief may ſupply all our needs and ſpiritual wants. Give us of the fulneſs of Chriſt Jeſus, grace for grace, that we may know that be liveth in us, as our Head, and we in and by him. Give us to be like him, and to imitate him in all holineſs. Make us to walk as he walked, that we may know that we are members of his body. Give us Patience, Humility, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Temperance, Chaſtity and Charity, Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Viviſication, Faith, and Obedience of his fulneſs. Give us all thoſe graces that any of thy Saints and Servants have had, and all thoſe degrees of grace. Give us all thoſe graces which thou haſt commanded us to have, and all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of grace. Make us perfect, as our heavenly Father is perfect.</hi>

Give us the peace of conſcience, and the Peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding. Give us the Joy which is in the Holy Ghoſt, which we enjoy in holy duties. Let us taſte and relliſh theſe ſweet enjoyments with more ſatisfaction and joy, that the exceſſes of our ſouls may be in theſe enjoyments, and we may keep them in our mouths, and hide them under our tongues, as we do ſweet morſels: And let the enjoyment of theſe carry us through all difficulties. Give us more
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34461:70"/>confidence in our acceſſes to the Throne of Grace, and a belief that thou art more ready to give, than we to ask; for thy fulneſs is more full, than our emptineſs is wanting. Thy fatherly care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for us, is more faithful, and careful to do it, than we to ſeek it; though we are reſolved to be alwaies begging and craving, becauſe we know we ſhall alwaies be wanting in this life, and we will not loſe our deſires, and thy bountiful gifts, for want of asking.</hi>

What then is there that we can buy it with, that is neither mony nor price? it can be nothing but to exchange our thirſt for the thing which we thirſt for, to relieve it, to open our mouths. Therefore as the cauſe which moved thee to make theſe invitations and promiſes was in thy ſelf, Lord ſeek in thy ſelf the cauſe which may move thee to perform them. The qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thirſt, want and need we have, and ſhall have as long as we have any life.

Let ſhowers of bleſſings come down upon thy people. Give us to lay hold of Chriſt for only Wiſdom, our only ſufficient Righteouſneſs, our Sanctification, and Redemption. Tread Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our feet, that we may bruiſe his head, as often as he goeth about to ſting our heel. Deſtroy his works. Let the Spirit of the Lord ſet up his ſtandard againſt him. And let not Antichriſt any more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Nations; but deſtroy thou him, and the Whore which is drunk with the blood of Saints. Succour thoſe that are tempted. Be with thy people in the fiery Tryal, that is to come upon all the world to try them; as thou waſt with</hi> Joſeph <hi>in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Lord, let not our ſins ſtand as a cloud to hinder theſe our prayers from aſcending to thee, or cauſe thee to turn away thine ear. For though they are ſo many, that we ſcarce know how to confeſs them, yet thou haſt pardoned as great ſinners as we, when they turned unto thee; and it is uſual with thee to ſeek thy loſt ſheep, and to receive thy returning Prodigals.</hi>

                  <p>THIS practice of the Servants of God is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; for we read of none of them who did not render unto God for his mercies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; ſo that he is none of God's people who omits this, neither doth he acknowledge God to be his benefactor. One ſacrificeth to his net, <hi>viz.</hi> to the ſubordinate means; another aſcribes all to chance and fortune; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit many prophane people too have made their acknowledgments to God; as <hi>Saul</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the beſt of the Cattel for ſacrifice. <hi>Cain</hi> would alſo ſacrifice. But of ſuch <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord;</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi>'s was. God ſpeaking of the degenerate <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſaith in the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah, They come before me as my people.</hi> For the light of nature (which is not eaſily extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) dictates this to us. Accordingly we read in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> of the Harlot pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her vows. They ſing praiſes to God juſt then when they are freed from their affliction; but within a while they forget God, and the wonders which he hath done for them.</p>
                  <p>To render ſome thing is an acknowledgment which we perform to one another; for we know we can hold nothing of another without a ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering. But the rendering which we muſt make
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34461:73"/>to God alwaies, is our heart, and all we can do and ſuffer for him. <hi>Hanna</hi> did not think it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to render the fruit of her lips, but thought ſhe had enough favour ſhewed her that her prayers were heard, and was, ſatisfied therewith, and thankfully rendered the intire benefit received.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> did not ſatisfy himſelf with praiſing and magnifying God, and reſolving to praiſe him as long as he lived; but he would have built a Temple to him too, but that God would not ſuffer him; yet he proceded in that purpoſe ſo far as he could; for he provided the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for the Temple.</p>
                  <p>And ſhall I think it enough to offer God thanks and praiſe? (for though this is honouring God) yet why ſhould I ſuffer my ſelf to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the weaker ſex? why ſhould I think to keep all Gods benefits to my ſelf? for my own uſe? ſhe for one prayer heard, and for own favour received, renders the ſame again, becauſe ſhe had no other thing of equal value to her.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall I render for ſo many prayers heard, and for ſo many mercies received? I am at a loſs what I ſhall render; but I am reſolved to do all I can, and ſuffer all I can for him, and to Sacrifice my moſt endeared luſt to him. <hi>I will praiſe the Lord with my mouth, and my tongue ſhall faile when I tell of his mercies; for I know no end of them.</hi> But this ſhall not ſuffice me; I muſt endeavour to build up his Temple too as far as I may; not any Temple made with hands, but I have frequent occaſion to meditate how much God doth for me, and how little do I for God!
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34461:74"/>and taking a view of the deſignes and intereſts which the world in general carrieth on, and how vigilant they are, and induſtrious in their own ſecular intereſts, inſomuch that they quite lay aſide the deſign of Jeſus Chriſt, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of Gods Glory, of goodneſs, and vertue, and every grace: Yet there muſt be a holy ſeed, a peculiar people zealous of good works, and a Spiritual Temple, and there muſt be ſome to carry on the holy intereſt and deſigne of Gods glory both by doing, and ſuffering gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and therefore I have reſolved to my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt ability, to promote this, and the rather, becauſe I ſee ſo many carrying on Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as if the Devil were let looſe. Ten Lepers were cleanſed: They all received equal benefit but one only of ten acknowledged his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and returned him thanks, let not the paucity of thy companions diſcourage thee in thy duty and good reſolutions.</p>
                  <p>Lord that I may do thee this ſervice the better, affect me ſo with the ſenſe of thy mercys and goodneſs now and alwaies, as I was affected when I firſt received them: For then I admired thy goodneſs, and thought I could never love thee enough, and praiſe thee enough. And then I enjoied the ſweetneſs of thy mercys, but much more I enjoied the ſweetneſs of thy ſelf, for I did enjoy thee as the Lord God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient. And as a God hearing prayer, and as My God.</p>
                  <p>And I enjoied my ſelf as thy Servant.</p>
                  <p>And that I may the better do this duty of thankfulneſs, let me remember the affliction and oppreſſion, ſorrow and grief, fear and fearful
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34461:74"/>miſgiving of mind that I lay under before, the Lord delivered me, and let it be evermore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and affect me with the ſenſe of it elſe I can never be thankful enough for thy mercy, for ſo thou preſcribedſt to thy antient people the <hi>Jews,</hi> that when they brought their offerings before thee, they ſhould make their recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſay a <hi>Syrian</hi> ready to periſh was my Father, and came down to <hi>Aegypt</hi> with a few, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And I find holy <hi>David</hi> praiſing God in this manner. <hi>Praiſed be the Lord who remembered us in our low eſtate, Pſal.</hi> And few there be who may not (as fitly as he) uſe this form. But if there be any who have not experienced this condition, it is to be feared they ſhall; for as great as they are reduced daily.</p>
                  <p>He alſo remembers his fears before God and praiſeth him for his deliverance from them all.</p>
                  <p>And there is no man ſo valiant but ſometimes his fears make him at his wits ends, therefore all man-kind may uſe this form too.</p>
                  <p>And for deliverance from troubles we may all praiſe God, as we find him doing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.</p>
                  <p>He further praiſeth God for deliverance from afflictions, from breaking his bones, <hi>ibid.</hi> We alſo may remember the time when we have narrowly ſcaped the like danger: Therefore we muſt acknowledge it thankfully to Gods gracious preſervation.</p>
                  <p>He praiſeth God alſo for raiſing him up from his ſickneſs. This occaſion of praiſe we all have had. He praiſeth him for delivering him from his enemies, and all that will live Godly muſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34461:75"/>have enemies, as he had, and ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to praiſe God for delivering them from them. He that is born after the fleſh will perſecute him that is born after the Spirit, but ſhall not prevail againſt him: For if he ſhould prevail, how then were it better that a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were hanged about his neck, and he were caſt into the Sea, then that he ſhould offend them that are ſuch?</p>
                  <p>And all thoſe that belong to God, may ſay with him. By this I know that thou favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me, becauſe mine enemie doth not prevail againſt me, for the Lord will not leave them in the hand of their enemies, though they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them, and wrong them in word and deed, and deſpitefully uſe them, and ſay all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evil of them falſely.</p>
                  <p>He only that is little in his own eyes can be thankful to God. Therefore <hi>David</hi> aſſaying to give God praiſe for his mercies, firſt ſtrips himſelf of all pretence of merit, ſaying. <hi>What am I, and what is my Fathers houſe?</hi> And the bleſſed Virgin in her magnificat aſcribes lowneſs to her ſelf; whom God exalted ſo highly.</p>
                  <p>He only can bleſs God for afflictions, who is ſenſible of his ſtraying inclination. And Gods reſtraining goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>The troubles of the righteous are many, but the Lord delivers them out of all. Therefore their thanks and praiſes of God muſt not be few. <hi>I will ſhew forth all his praiſes,</hi> ſaith he in the <hi>Pſalms. And I will alwaies give thanks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord; his praiſe ſhall ever be in my mouth, Pſal.</hi> 34. He ſhews the cauſe; In the multitude of the ſorrows that I had in my
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34461:75"/>heart, thy comforts have refreſhed my ſoul. If we are ſenſible that God hath heard our prayers, we muſt remember too that he hath heard our vows. It is but a reaſonable impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a never-failing Benefactor; <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee, and thou ſhalt praiſe me, Pſal.</hi> For we receive our wages before we perform our ſervice.</p>
                  <p>And what doth it avail the Lord? and what doth accrew to him whether we are delivered, or whether we periſh in our affliction? our praiſes is all that redounds to him, the benefit to us.</p>
                  <p>This duty is ſo delightful and ſatisfying in the very act of performance, that it is a reward to it ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be ſatisfied as with marrow and ſatneſs, when my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips.</hi> Thus he ſings ſweetly in the ears of God, of Angels, and of good men, and in his own ears too; or elſe how was he ſo fully ſatisfied whilſt he performed it? And why elſe did he ſo often perform it? with ſuch ſtudied variety? Certainly it doth much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light a man to recount how much God hath favoured him, helped, and heard him.</p>
                  <p>The Royal Prophet doth not only recount his own troubles, and ſorrows, and perils, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, that he had gone through from his youth up; but he recounts alſo the National mercies; what God wrought for them when he brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and downward to his own time. Alſo he admires God's goodneſs to all ſorts of men in affliction; as at large may be ſeen in the 107 <hi>Pſal.</hi> as particularly to men driven from their own place and Country, into
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34461:76"/>ſtrange Lands, wandering without ſuccour. To priſoners caſt into dungeons, becauſe of their ſin. To ſick men, and to ſeafaring men, when they reel to and fro, and ſtagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits end; then they cry unto the Lord, and he delivers them; <hi>Lord, How Good, How Gracious art thou!</hi> When our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo deſperate, that we know not what to do, which way to turn us: And know no way to eſcape, no more than he that flies from a Lion, and is torn in pieces by a Bear. When we ſee that we cannot be delivered without God will pleaſe to work a miracle. When we ſeem to our ſelves irrecoverable, like the dried Bones in the Valleys (in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Prophecy) or like a dead Tree withered and plucked up. In this forelorn and hopeleſs condition, when no man regards our periſhing, we come to God for help, and he in whoſe only power it is to help, doth help us, and deliver us, and makes the dry bones live, and we have ſeen the ſalvation of the Lord, and the wonders that he doth for the Sons of men; and have been tranſported with joy, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they came out of <hi>Babylon</hi> were.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge that there be ſome who come in no misfortune, nor are plagued like other men: But all thoſe whom Chriſt Jeſus hath choſen to be his ſouldiers; he trains up in this diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>But if it were ſo, that I had not gone thorow ſuch perils, ſuch afflictions, and ſuch troubles, as I ſee and hear to befall other men. Have I not much more cauſe to praiſe God for keeping me in health, than for raiſing me up again, being
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34461:76"/>fallen ſick? from keeping me from the perils which befall other men, than for delivering me, if I had been in danger, and for keeping me from troubles wherein others are plunged. If I conſider the calamities of men far greater than my ſelf: As for inſtance of him who is more worth than thouſands of us, our Soveraign Lord the King. Can I chuſe but bleſs God that my diſtreſſes, afflictions, and perils of life, have not been ſo many and great as his? But how great and good above me was he that was after God's own heart? What pains, perils and troubles did he not go thorow firſt in his perſon; his reins chaſtened him in the night; he had no ſoundneſs in his bones; then from his ſuperiours, <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuting him as long as he lived; from his inferiours; his ſervant curſeth him to his face; from unkind neighbours, as <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite;</hi> from his Relations, his wife ſcoffing him, his Son rebelling, and another commits a rape on his Siſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Beſides the temporal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, he alſo tells us what God hath done for his ſoul too, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. and bleſſeth God for forgiving all his ſin, <hi>&amp;c. ib.</hi> For this we can never praiſe God enough.</p>

                  <p>Lord, above all things, give me to fear ſin, and the tranſgreſſion of thy Law, who art the great Soveraign of the world, its Creator and Preſerver, to whom we owe both our perſons and obedience; and if the <hi>Gentiles</hi> do by nature the things contained in the Law, much more let me who have as well the written Law and the Goſpel, as the Law of Nature, do the things contained in the Law, elſe how ſhall I eſcape thy wrath? But (having tryed our obedience) thou haſt found us all rebels, and in thy juſtice mayeſt damn us all, if thy mercy in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus do not ſave us.</p>
                  <p>Since Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Law, and the glorious Angels fulfil thy commandments, and hearken to the voice of thy word, and man hath no ſuch perfection as his Saviour, or the Angels; but our wiſdom and our perfection is in obedience to the Law: Inable us to keep it; for herein God hath ſhewed us what is good, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8.</p>
                  <p>Every child of God is as a ſouldier keeping a garriſon in an enemies Country. Therefore Lord, as I put on my apparel, let me remember to put on the Armour of light, and to watch and be provided to fight thy battels, let me not be deſtitute of any piece of this Armour, but give me all Chriſtian vertues. I am naked naturally, and without this Armour; but unleſs I have it of thy gift, I cannot put it on, but muſt periſh by my nakedneſs, for I cannot have any truſe from my ſpiritual adverſary who watches to deſtroy us.</p>
                  <p>And give me the skill of an expert warriour to uſe theſe Armes againſt the Devil, the World
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34461:78"/>and the fleſh; inable me to put off all ſins which hinder the planting, and growth of grace in our hearts, for we cannot ſerve God and mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; let me depart from evil, that I may do good. Let me feel the power of Chriſt's death, that I may partake of his reſurrection. Let the ſenſe of my forepaſt ſins make me the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in thy ſervice. Since my darkneſs is paſſed, let me put off the works of darkneſs. Let me not delay conſidering my danger, and the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of life, and the greatneſs of the reward. if I do thy ſervice: For to him that is faithful in much, thou wilt give much; ten Cities for improving his five talents to that number.</p>
                  <p>That I may fear ſin, and not make light of it, or a mock of it, as fools are ſaid to do; let me conſider the great evil of it: That it is the fooliſhneſs and brutiſhneſs of a man, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and nakedneſs, the blindneſs and ſottiſhneſs, and death of the ſoul, which makes us ſaid to be dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; and that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſin are the worſt of evils. That it makes us like to the Devils. That one ſin makes us prone to all other ſins: As <hi>David</hi>'s adultery made way for murther: As the Heathen who liked not to retain God in their thoughts, God gave them up to all uncleanneſs: So it hardens the heart againſt repentance, and blinds the mind, that it cannot underſtand good from evil: And finally, that it loſeth God's favour, and all things that are worth deſiring, and makes us liable to endure all evils that are worthy to be feared; and let theſe conſiderations work in me an antipathy to it. And on the contrary, that I
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34461:78"/>may apprehend the excellency of holineſs, and the fear of the Lord; which is the beſt of good things, as ſin is the worſt of evils; and as ſin is the greateſt folly and ſtupidity, ſo holineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe is the greateſt wiſdom, and to fear God, and do thereafter, is good underſtanding. That the righteous is more excellent than his neighbour; and they that are precious in God's eyes, are honourable; that it makes us like the Saints, and like to Chriſt, and like God; to be perfect, as God is perfect; to be holy, as he is holy: That it is our ſecurity, and ingages God to be a Sun of perpetual comfort, and a ſhield of defence to us. That if we do good, none will harm us. But to the wicked there is no peace. And that it gains God's favour, and all thoſe things that are worth deſiring in this life. And eternally Lord! Let theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons work in me a hunger and thirſt after grace.</p>
                  <p>O give me to apprehend the terrour of the Lord! that I may fear him accordingly, to conſider that thou gaveſt the Law with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightning; that thoſe that deſpiſed <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Law died without mercy; that I may fear to offend againſt the Goſpel, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, counting it unholy, as all that are not ſanctified by it do. Let me apprehend the ſtrictneſs of thy precept. Thou haſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we keep thy precepts diligently. That we have covenanted in Baptiſm to do it; and upon our repentance likewiſe, and renewing of cur Covenant with thee; and every thought of our hearts is under this Law. Therefore that I may walk accordingly, let me be diligent in all God's Ordinances, which are both food and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34461:79"/>phyſick to the ſoul. Let me uſe frequent prayer, which will ſurely make me weary of ſinning; if ſin doth not make me weary of praying. And give me unweariedneſs and conſtancy in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reading, ſearching and meditating in the Scriptures. Let me hide thy Word in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee. Let the Word convey the Spirit into me, ſince it is received by the hearing of faith, and not by the works of the Law; and let me often renew my Covenant with thee in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>LORD, ſince thou promiſeſt a reward to him who overcomes. Let me have grace to fight thy battels, and let me not expect the reward till I have done thy ſervice; let me contemn the labour, and the allurements that would divert me, while I look upon the incouragement. Though Satan offereth preſent rewards for ſin, and puts an edge upon the temptations, and makes them ſuit my temper, either in the things of the world, or the fleſh, and my heart is ready to betray me within, and my reaſon is ready to follow my appetite, yet let my jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy over my heart, and my conſtant watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs prevail againſt them all, through Chriſt Jeſus by whom only we can overcome ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful an adverſary as Satan is, who is unwearied in his temptations: For we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, nor by fleſh and blood, but by Faith in Chriſt, upon whom we rely for the victory. Therefore give us the ſhield of faith. Faith reflecting upon the glory to come, and the love of Chriſt paſt, who left Heaven for us, that we might leave earth for him. And
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34461:79"/>let us know that we fight Chriſts battels, an that he is our Captain, and will ſuccour his that are tempted, and we ſhall be able to do all things through him that ſtrengthens us when we call upon him.</p>
                  <p>And fighting thy battels, and overcoming thy enemies, give me the promiſed reward of bleſſedneſs, the white ſtone, the ſentence of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from the guilt of ſin, and the ſeal of thy favour to my ſoul, whereby I ſhall taſte the joys of Heaven which the men of the world apprehend not.</p>
                  <p>THAT I may fear to ſin, let me weigh ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the ſeeming pleaſure, and profit it offers, with its loſſes it brings. What profit have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleaſures ſatisfying the ſenſes, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the fancy, the vain breath of mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; unleſs I view Heaven, and happineſs as fables, how can I neglect them for theſe baſe things? or Satan and my own luſts beguiles me, and deceive me? for if I were indifferent in my Judgment, I muſt needs contemne theſe poor bates, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did after he had made tryal of them. O Lord inlighten my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and rectify my Judgment, and my depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved will and affections, that I may not be chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor be willing to be deceived; that I may not buy pleaſure at ſo dear a rate, being a lover of it, more than of God, who is bleſſed for ever; let me not ſet ſo light by God, and bleſſedneſs, and Heaven, and my true eternal intereſt, teach me to fear the loſs of my ſoul, and the favour of God, and the peace of conſcience, all which either early or late, the ſinner finds he loſeth. Give me that ſpiritual eye ſalve whereby I may
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34461:80"/>diſcern the vizard and ſucus of ſin. Teach me to conſider all the ſeeming gainers by ſin: youthful perſons, who are in the ſtrength, and vigor of their age, who make the moſt, and the beſt of their pleaſure, of whoſe merry meetings, the wiſe man hath ſaid, Their laughter is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And the ſins of their youth are the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of their age, when they cry out with <hi>Job,</hi> Remember not the ſins of my youth; and thou makeſt me poſſeſs the ſins of my youth, or what gaine can the great ones of the earth boaſt of, though they drink a greater draught of pleaſures than other men? who the more they ſeem to gain, the more they loſe; they loſe the peace of conſcience, and the favour of God, and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; but if any gaine, it is thoſe who after ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are ſaved by repentance: But theſe, all their life after do complain of nothing but there ſins, and with great difficulty do recover their peace with God and their conſcience; for what likelihood is there that that ſhould prove profitable to any that God doth forbid, or would God gaine any profit by it, if it were my loſs to forbear it? the Lord doth not envy us, he that can afford us Heaven, would he grudge us the pleaſure of ſin which the Devel will allow us? can this be good for us, that is againſt God? is that like to be a mans good which deprives a man of internal peace and injoiment of himſelf, and which every man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in preſent or afterwards doth ſpeak againſt? can that be gainful to a man that loſeth his ſouls eternal ſalvation? If the ſhip be drowned in the ocean, all that is in it is drowned. What gain can that be, that is ſo ſhort, that in the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34461:80"/>next moment we muſt ſay it was, and is not? and for that we have loſt eternal happineſs: Or had I lived the daies of <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> and all my daies had been daies of pleaſure, and this were my laſt day, what would remain of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it all? or what joy, or ſatisfaction, or comfort to beare me up againſt the fear of death? would not a little tidings of death, and Judgment, confound me in the midſt of my pomp, and jovialty, as it did <hi>Nebuchadnezzer.</hi> Do not the wickedeſt when they ſin, think to repent of it? and would they ſo, if it were there gaine, and commodity? or if I ſhould get by ſin, would not that gaine be loſs? ſhould I not throw away riches gotten by unjuſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my unfeigned repentance? did not <hi>Judas</hi> throw away his 30 pieces? what man in all the world, either that repented, or that repented not, ever gained by ſin? What gained <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Cain,</hi> the old world? <hi>Jeruſalem, Sodom, Sampſon, Lot, David,</hi> or <hi>Peter?</hi> but beſides, that it coſts the penitent ſinner, what hath it coſt Chriſt? therefore as thou haſt made us reaſonable men (O Lord) let us make choice of that that will make us happy, thy favour, and let us not ſell it, and all our happineſs as it were for a meſs of pottage. If ſinners think nothing too dear for ſin, let me think nothing too dear for Heaven. When ſinners caſt away their ſouls for a luſt, and yet ſay that we loſe our labour for Heaven, how incompetent Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are they; but of holineſs what fruit have we not? what is it not profitable for, either in this life, or that which is to come? it confers all that ſin would ſtrip us of.</p>

                  <p>That I may fear to ſin, Let me conſider that our God is a conſuming fire, though he be ours; ſo that we are his people, yet our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges muſt not exempt us from this fear; for thou haſt commanded us to abſtain from ſin for this cauſe; and all thy people. Whoever ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned found thee a conſuming fire to puniſh them; as did <hi>David;</hi> When he cried out, <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> The Lords judgments were grievious upon him; murther and rape commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his houſe his Son drave him from his Throne: ſo <hi>Eli</hi> felt this alſo when his Sons were vile, and he lightly reproved them; and <hi>Job,</hi> when he felt one ſpark of this fire, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, My ſoul chuſeth ſtrangling rather than life. Therefore let all thy people conſider the terrour of the Lord, and remember that thou art a conſuming fire; and let them walk in the fear of the Lord, and the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt. And as they call on the Father, who without reſpect of perſons judgeth every man according to his works; ſo let them paſs the time of their ſo journing here in fear, remembring that our bleſſed Saviour could not eſcape this fire, when he undertook the work of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for ſinners, but cryed out under it, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken men?</hi> And in reſpect of our proneneſs to ſin againſt God, let us keep our ſelves with this, as with a bridle and curb, and to keep up our vigilancy for religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties working out our ſalvation with fear and trembling, conſidering what it is to fall into the hands of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knowing that it is not a ſinful ſervile fear, which is to fear the ſmart more than
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34461:81"/>the offending of God; for this hath an enmity joyned with it; for whom we fear with ſervile fear, we hate; but this filial fear proceeds from love, and the tender ſenſe of God's diſpleaſure againſt ſin. And though we could ſay with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that we know we have a houſe in Heaven; yet was he ſtill keeping under his body for fear of ſinning. For the Righteous ſhall be recompenced on earth, and where ſhall the ungodly and ſinner appear? To theſe the Lord ſhall come in flaming fire, rendring ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to them that know not God, and to them that obey not the Goſpel. He will wound the head of his enemies. He that believeth not ſhall be damned. His wrath ſhall be poured out like fire. The indignation of the Lord ſhall conſume his adverſaries. The damned ſpirits, and fallen Angels, are under this fire. But thou haſt given thy Son Chriſt to be a Saviour, to ſave thy people from it. O Lord! ſave us through our dear Saviour's merits from this worm that never dies, and fire that never goes out; and let thy people fear not thoſe who can hurt the body only, but thoſe who can hurt both ſoul and body, and caſt both into Hell fire.</p>
                  <p>Lord, thou haſt pronounced them curſed who do thy work negligently: yet how negligent am I in all religious duties, and my heart goes ſometimes after covetouſneſs, and ſometimes after vanities? O give me thy grace! that I may ſerve thee with a perfect heart. That I may ſeek thee with my whole heart. Let me not think to divide my heart to God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; becauſe it is thine all, and thou wilt have
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34461:82"/>all or none, becauſe thou madeſt it, and Chriſt hath bought it. Let me not be weary of theſe duties, but be willing to labour in them, and wear out my body in them, and ſtrive with zeal wreſtling with the Lord for a bleſſing; ſince I have experience that thou art a God hearing prayer, and haſt not ſtopped thine ear to mine. O Lord God, I am not holy, but thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed we ſhall be all holy, and required that we ſhould be holy, as thou art holy; how infinitely ſhort doth the beſt of men come of this pattern? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſes he was carnal, ſold under ſin, and that he had not attained, but preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed forward, that he might attain. Lord, give us with him, to ſee our ſinfulneſs, that we may in like manner (as he was) be ſtirred up to ſtrive after holineſs, and fulfil thy promiſe, That we ſhall all be holy.</p>
                  <p>Lord, inlighten my underſtanding, that I may ſee what a ſhameful thing ſin is, that the very brute beaſts do not ſo brutiſhly as ſinners: For the Oxe, and Aſs, who know their owners, reprove them who refuſe to acknowledge thee to be their Lord; and all others, do more rationally without any reaſon, than man who hath underſtanding, yet caſts off all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and is not aſhamed of ſin. For it is a ſhame to ſpeak of the things that are done of them, yet are they not aſhamed when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them. O let me conſider how naked a ſinner renders himſelf to the view of the world! and when God himſelf ſhall put him to ſhame; as it is written, As thou haſt put the Son of God to open ſhame, ſo God ſhall put thee to ſhame. And when it ſhall be their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34461:82"/>work to think of the reaſons that moved them to ſin, and to refuſe ſuch duties; and to ſee the folly of all thoſe reaſons, this will be ſhame and confuſion. O Lord, let me be aſhamed of my ſins in time, ſavingly, by true repentance, that I may avoid the eternal ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and remember with grief all the hard thoughts which I have had of thee, and thy waies, and grieved that I turned no ſooner from ſin to God: That being derided for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, I have ſo little of it. But let me not be of them of whom it is ſaid, The Lord hath laughed at their calamity; for he hath ſeen that their day is coming. Made upon hearing of Mr. <hi>J. B.</hi>

                  <p>O Lord give me that earneſt, and firſt fruits of eternal life, which thou uſeſt to give thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſervants in this life, which may make me, as it did them, to rejoyce in afflictions with joy unſpeakable and glorious; to undergo with joy all manner of ſlanders, and to take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, knowing that they have a more enduring ſubſtance in Heaven; give thy ſervant to know this of himſelf, which may make me able for the like ſufferings, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo all that the wicked can inflict, not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of deliverance; and grant that I may ſee him by faith who is inviſible, and Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour, my Helper, and my Redeemer, my Recompence, and my Reward.</p>
                  <p>O Lord let me not put any ſtreſs upon my own works for my ſalvation. If with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Paul</hi> I could ſay, that as touching the Law I am blameleſs, yet then alſo muſt I not count that I have attained, but deſire to be found in Chriſt,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34461:83"/>not having mine own righteouſneſs; and be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that I have deſerved thy wrath, and fly to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I will make mention of thy Righteouſneſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> And with <hi>Daniel, Not for our righteouſneſs, but for thy mercy ſake ſave us.</hi> Deliver me from the Legal Phariſaical ſpirit, thinking to eſtabliſh its own righteouſneſs, not ſubmitting to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Let my righteouſneſs exceed theirs. Let me mortifie the body, and live ſtrictly as they did: and whatever duties they performed, let me perform: but let me not leave the others undone; and thoſe which I do, let me not do to be ſeen, but let me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them to thee in ſecret, that thou mayeſt reward me openly. Neither let me truſt in my felf, nor deſpiſe others, nor ſtrain at a Nat, and ſwallow a Camel.</p>
                  <p>Lord, let not worldly things diſturb my quiet; though the Earth be moved, and the Mountains ſhake at the tempeſt of the ſame. Let the River of Life of thy holy City, make glad the people thereof. Give me the peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs. Give me grace, voluntarily to take Chriſt's yoak upon me, and to learn of him meekneſs and humility, that I may find reſt to my ſoul, which I can never find without holineſs of life, and faith; therefore give me both, that I may be able to ſay, in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Lord is my Shepherd, therefore I can lack norhing.</p>
                  <p>Lord, as thou haſt given us many commands for the duty of prayer, and watchfulneſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with conſtancy, without ceaſing; and that in all things we ſhould make our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34461:83"/>known unto God, and to incourage us herein, thou haſt promiſed to reward it openly; what we pray for ſecretly, and haſt ſet forth unto us in thy word how thou art a God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring prayer, and many examples of it. And that it is the duty in which thou doſt moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and by my own experience I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found thee ſuch. Therefore let me redeem the time for this ſo beneficial duty, according to the example of thy Servants. <hi>David</hi> ſeven times a day, and <hi>Daniel</hi> three times in ſpight of the Tirants threats; for thou haſt always given me the mercies which I asked, and I fear I have loſt many for want of asking.</p>
                  <p>Lord in my diſtreſſes, and troubles, let me not ſeek for vain comforts in the Creatures, but for thoſe comforts which thy word and thy Spirit afford thy Servants; for Chriſt hath promiſed, that he will not leave us comfortleſs, but will ſend us a comforter. O now ſend this comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into my heart, that I may rejoice with the joy of thy choſen ones, and not with the joy of the World, this thou haſt often refreſhed thy Servant with, in the midſt of the ſorrows which he had in his heart.</p>
                  <p>Lord let me not neglect the day of my viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for thou haſt ſaid that thy ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with us. Therefore when we feel thy holy Spirit inclining our hearts to good, or drawing us from evil, let us follow its motions and the expreſs calls of thy word, when it ſeems to us, to ſpeak in particular to our ſoules, that we may eſcape that threatning which ſaith, becauſe I have called, and ye have refuſed, you ſhall call, and I will not anſwer: I will laugh at
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34461:84"/>your calamity; ſo when thou viſiteſt us with mercies or afflictions, then thou boweſt our ear to diſcipline; for in affliction the wicked of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten will ſeek thee; but not to ſee thee in thy merciful diſpenſations is more brutiſh then the Ox, or Aſs who know their keepers that feed them. Lord let me know the time of my viſitation; let me loſe no opportunity to do good; for we know not how ſoon the opportunity, or our lives will be taken away; therefore let me lay hold on all opportunities, and redeem all time poſſible for God's ſervice: As <hi>Paul</hi> in the Gaol converted the Gaoler; and <hi>Philip</hi> in his Journey the Eunuch; and Chriſt when he was on the Croſs dying, conveyed grace to the hearers, and ſalvation to one of the thieves. Let me value my time by the duties which may be done in it; and let me not ſpend it in doing that which is impertinent, or doing nothing; much leſs in doing ill; but in things neceſſary; which is but one thing, to ſerve God; the things of this world being only for convenience. Teach me to number not only my daies, but my hours, that I may husband them well to thy glory; eſpecially my youthful time let me conſecrate to God, ſince I cannot be too ſoon out of the paw of Satan, into the arms of Chriſt: Let me not liſten to the Devil when he tells me I ſhall ſerve God hereafter; but let me give thee the firſt fruits of my age, and of the day, and not the flower to the Devil, and the dregs to the Lord; and let me conſider what value I ſhall have of time when I come to die.</p>
                  <p>Lord, when thy afflicting hand is ſtretched out to afflict me in the ruine of my eſtate, or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34461:84"/>the loſs of my reputation and honour, or any earthly good, how do I ſearch and try my ſpirit, and fear to commit the leaſt ſin againſt thee? but no ſooner haſt thou removed thy hand, and the danger that threatned is overpaſt, but then how careleſs do I walk again? and think not of the terror of the Lord, to keep my heart in awe, neither do I fear thee, according to my fear I had when in danger; neither do I ſeek to thee, ſerve thee, and delight in thee, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all my vows, and admiration of thy goodneſs; becauſe thou haſt been ſo merciful to hear my prayer, and deliver me from all my fear, but I am ready to think that it is for my own goodneſs and virtue, that thou haſt wrought this. Of this ſin thou warnedſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and we are all too prone to it; O pardon Lord thy ſervant, and heal him of this evil; and give him to walk in the ſame awe and fear of thee, and the like obedience to all thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and love to thy waies; watchfulneſs againſt ſin, and in it ſelf examination, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity when the trouble and danger is paſt, as when it is impendent, and then I ſhall know that I have a filial fear of thee, and not a ſervile fear.</p>
                  <p>Lord, ſince thou makeſt thy Mercy, and thy Almighty Power, the inducements to awe us, and allure us to keep and obſerve thy Statutes, ſaying to <hi>Iſrael, I am the Lord, the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, and out of the houſe of bondage;</hi> therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynedſt thy people to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments following. Let me alwaies keep a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thy mercies; and becauſe thou
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34461:85"/>didſt injoyn them the keeping of the Paſſeover, in commemoration of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that they ſhould continually when they made their offering acknowledge, that their Father was a <hi>Syrian</hi> ready to periſh; Lord let us in like ſort reflect upon thy mercies and deliverances, and our former ſufferings, to humble us, and to be thankful to thee, and praiſe thee; and whilſt we enjoy the benefit, let us give thee the glory; and the rather, becauſe one mercy is the earneſt of another; as holy <hi>Paul</hi> argued; God hath delivered me, and will deliver me, therefore let me put a due eſtimate upon them, by apprehending my unworthineſs of them, which the more I apprehend, the more able I ſhall be to know the true value of the mercy, and God's goodneſs in it. The more low I am in my own eyes, the more high will God's mercies be in my eyes. If we pray for mercies, it is for love of our ſelves; but our praiſes are not ſo many, nor ſo earneſt as our prayers for them. Lord increaſe our praiſes, and let us ſay with <hi>David, Praiſed be the Lord who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred us in our low condition, and hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from all our fears and troubles, and keepeth all our bones, ſo that none of them is broken, and ladeth us with daily benefits, and maketh our life comfortable.</hi> And let my ſoul praiſe him not only with my lips, but with a conſtant living to his praiſe, and uſing the mercies which he hath given me to the honour of him who gave them.</p>
                  <p>Lord give us grace to mortifie our earthly members and affections, ſince the promiſe is, that as we have been planted with Chriſt into the ſimilitude of his death, ſo we ſhall alſo be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34461:85"/>into the ſimilitude of his reſutrection. And let this mortification be univerſal of all our ſinful and ſenſual affections; and let it be conſtant and perpetual, without intermiſſion, looking to the pattern of Chriſt on his Croſs for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inſtructed thereto by thy holy Word, and ſtirred up thereto by a godly ſorrow for our ſins committed. And to this end let us cut off the ſuperfluities of every luſt and corruption, that may fortifie and ſtrengthen it: And that we may deſtroy it in the birth; and keep far off the danger of it; as holy <hi>Job</hi> made a Covenant with his eyes not to look upon a Maid, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I can never be ſafe near a danger: though ſin ſeem to me as a right eye, or hand, yet by thy grace let me have power to renounce it, not only forbearing the act for fear of puniſhment, but deſtroying and mortifying the habit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: And although the body of ſin and death do remain, as in <hi>Paul</hi> it did, yet let it be to me as a burthen and grief of ſoul, crying out with him, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin and death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>LORD God, the fountain of goodneſs, above all things give me faith in thee, for then I muſt of neceſſity love thee, if I believe thou haſt loved me, and given thy Son for me, and ſhall have in my ſoul the joy that is unſpeakable.</p>
                  <p>Lord, when thou layeſt thy heavy hand of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction upon us, to cauſe us to ſearch and try our waies, and that we ſhould examine our ſelves, and turn unto the Lord; in ſtead of this our wicked heart is prone to caſt off God, and ſay, Why ſhould we wait upon God any more? what profit is there in ſerving him? Who is the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34461:86"/>Lord? we will own him, and his goodneſs no more: In ſtead of humble repentance, we are prone with <hi>Job</hi>'s wife to curſe God; and with thoſe wicked ones propheſied of to come in the laſt times, in the book of the <hi>Revelations;</hi> of whom 'tis ſaid, That after all the Vials of wrath and the 7 laſt Plagues poured out, they repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, but curſed God, or elſe we are prone to charge God fooliſhly, as they in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.12. ſaid, <hi>God hath forſaken the earth,</hi> or 18 <hi>Ezek. That our Fathers have eaten ſowre grapes, and our teeth are ſet on edge;</hi> yet we their children have eaten ſowre grapes too: or we are tempted to have hard ſpeeches of God, accompanying our natural complaints, and call God's providence into queſtion, as if thou didſt not govern the earth, or not well; becauſe we think thou doſt not hear us ſoon enough, ſaying, <hi>Why have we faſted, and thou heareſt not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that we may eſchew theſe iniquities, let us ſee firſt the fruitleſneſs of this courſe; though we roar all like Bears, and mourn like Doves, it doth not better us, nor abate our afflictions. So is it cauſeleſs, for thy plagues are the juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for our ſins: and it is the Lord's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that we are not conſumed (as ſaid the Church in <hi>Babylon</hi>) and that we are living. And why ſhould a living man complain for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſins? for that we are alive is more than we deſerve. That thou giveſt us our life for a prey; for we know we are all ſinners, and our ſins exceed our puniſhments. It was never ſo bad, but it might have been worſe with us; and at the worſt we have ſome mercy. For <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know that of very faithfulneſs thou
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34461:86"/>haſt afflicted me.</hi> In thus murmuring we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look all Gods mercies. As <hi>Haman,</hi> when he had reckoned all his advancements yet ſaid, all this is nothing ſo long as <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Jew vailed not to him. In this we ſhew our exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great pride, which makes us think all that God hath given us is no more than our due.</p>
                  <p>In this is direct rebellion againſt our God, and denying the Lord, and his juſtice, and his holineſs: all which blaſphemies are hereby committed, and God ſummoned to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bar, and we condemn him of injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>LORD, heal us of theſe our iniquities, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our complaints, that we may have none but filial complaints to thy ſelf, as our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus, who ſaid, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And whatever we ſuffer, to ſay with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> in his expoſtulation, <hi>Lord, thou art Righteous, yet let me reaſon with thee; Why doth the ungodly proſper?</hi> And in all extremity of afflictions, retain this thought of God; that he is righteous and good: And let our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the inſtruments of our afflictions be mixed with prayers for them, as <hi>Stephens</hi> were. And let us ſtrive to bring up our wills to God's will, and to ſubmit all to thee, ſaying, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did, <hi>Lord, if it be poſſible let this cup paſs from me, Nevertheleſs, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, that thou mayeſt remove thy afflicting hand, and thy Rod, and thy ſervants ſins, and puniſhments may be removed; let us firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our lives, and forſake our ſins: Search and try our waies to find out the ſins we lie under: For thou haſt ſaid, If thy people which
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34461:87"/>are in Captivity ſhall bethink themſelves, and turn unto thee, thou wilt help them; but if when thou hearkneſt, thou heareſt no man ſpeak righteouſly, or to ſay what have I done? how canſt thou repent of the puniſhment when we repent not of our ſins? Let us therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from whence we are fallen, and let us turne again to the Lord, and forſake our wicked waies, leſt thou ſayeſt to us as to <hi>Iſrael</hi> thou ſayedſt (10 <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.) <hi>You have forſaken me, go and cry unto the Gods that ye have ſerved.</hi> And having tried our waies, and forſaken our wickedneſs, let us in humble, holy, fervent prayer, lift up our hearts with our hands to our God in the Heavens. Saying, <hi>we have tranſgreſſed and rebelled but thou haſt pardoned.</hi> Thus <hi>Davi'd</hi> Princes took counſel againſt him but he gave himſelf to prayer, and thus the Marriners in the ſtorm to <hi>Jonas,</hi> awake thou ſluggard and call upon the name of thy God. And then our God will ſave us, as he did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Babylon;</hi> under <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> when commiſſions were out to ſlay them. And his hand is not ſhortned to us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he forgotten to be gracious to them who confeſs their ſins with their aggravations, as the Prophet doth, we have tranſgreſſed and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And juſtify God, as <hi>Ezra.</hi> Thou haſt puniſhed us leſs then our iniquities have deſerved. Made upon hearing of a Sermon to the ſame effect.</p>
                  <p>LORD, whatever duties I perform unto thee, let me do them from the principle of love, and not of cuſtom, or neceſſity to ſilence the natural or awakened conſcience, ſince thou accepteſt the will more than the gift, as thou didſt the poor widows two mites; and it is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34461:87"/>this that perfumes our Sacrifices, and it is thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that thy word calls the fulfilling the law. And all that thou haſt required of us is contained in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> (as it is writen) what doth the Lord require of thee, but that thou love the Lord thy God? and my Son give me thy heart. O Lord God take this poor worthleſs heart, too good for the World, and thoſe brutiſh pleaſures which we ſo willingly give it to, and eagerly, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly affect, but not any way good enough for thee, who by thy bounty, and beneficence to us, every day doſt oblige us more than all we have, or can doe will requite; but the world can do no ſuch things for us; and if beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, excellency, worth, wiſdom, kindneſs, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, parentage, free love, pardon; or any other motive whatſoever would prevail to win, and allure us, in thee it is. I will therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to devote my affections to thee, and ever to begin my meditation in the morning when I awake, with the ſweet remembrance of thy undeſerved kindneſs to me. When we were caſt out in our blood, in the open field, in the day of our nativity, when no Eye pitied us, to waſh us, ſwaddle us, ſalt us, bath us, and bind us up, then thou paſſedſt by, and caſtedſt thy eye of love upon us, and didſt all theſe things for us and nouriſhedſt us, and broughſt us up, and then the time of love was, and thou madeſt us beautiful, and comely in thy own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and marriedſt us to thy ſelf, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt upon us thy ſelf: And all that is thine: And all that are thine. And all this didſt thou to us, as a ſtranger paſſing by, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, for what had our periſhing been to thee? but thou as the good <hi>Samartan,</hi> didſt freely pity
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34461:88"/>us; nay, while we were thy enimies thou didſt all this for us, ſhall not all this love move us? nor, is this all? <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what the Lord hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> If we conſider the particular benefits we have received from the hand of God, and how highly we valued them, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſought them before we had them, and the great evils we have been deliverd from, and how much we feared them, and how reſtleſs we were in the fear, till we were delivered from them, we ſhall admire thy goodneſs, and love thee with admiration. And if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy excellency, we may love, and admire the perfection, and beauty of thee; and thine infinite wiſdome, and power in all thy works, in the Heavens, in the earth, and in the ocean, in the Sun, Moon, Stars, the Seaſons of the year the living creatures, and in the ſmalleſt of them. O Lord, ſince we cannot but ſee all lovelineſs, excellency and deſirableneſs in thee, let our firſt, and laſt meditations begin, and end the the day with thee, eager to take the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of approaching thy throne, and as loath to leave the ſweet contemplation of thy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>O Lord God almighty, thy holy word teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, That except we eat thy Sons body, and drink his blood, we have no life in us. And that whoſo eateth his fleſh, and drinketh his blood hath eternal life. (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53, 54.) Give us worthily to receive this Sacrament, that we may have eternal life. Give us to come to it with grace in our heart, that our graces may
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34461:88"/>be increaſed, and ſtrengthened, as by the food of our ſouls, as the body is by the food of the body; which is not betterd by food, if it be not living; no more can our ſouls be, if we be dead in treſpaſſes and ſins: and as the body turns the moſt wholſom nouriſhment to its hurt, to diſeaſes, if the ſtomach be full of ill humours; ſo our ſouls ſhall be worſe, (as <hi>Judas</hi> was) for theſe holy Sacraments, if we come not to them prepared with repentance. Therefore as the Lord was pleaſed to waſh his Diſciples feet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave them the Sacrament of his body, and blood, that they might be clean, and fit for the perception of theſe myſteries; ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this example, let thy faithful people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves with repentance, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charity; and if we remember that our neighbour hath any thing againſt us, ler us leave our gift at the Altar, and go, and be firſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to our neighbour, and then perform our Sacrifice to God; and apprehending and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord's body, that we commit no irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. And as our ſouls are prepared, ſo let us prepare our bodies, as thy ſervant <hi>David,</hi> when he eat the ſhew bread (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.5.) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Prieſt. Women had been kept from them three daies, and the veſſels of the young men were holy. Let our bodies be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by faſting, temperance, abſtinence, prayer, and humiliation, leſt as the Ark of the Covenant, by which the Lord conveyed the greateſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> being taken by the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> brought to them the greateſt calamities, and ſo it did to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> for but touching it irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently. In like manner theſe heavenly gifts,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34461:89"/>if we eat them unworthily, ſhall prove our damnation, and if they who but touched the hem of his garments, or received him into their houſe; received ſuch benefits, ſhall not they who receive him into their ſouls be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all their infirmities? and as the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent martyrs, by receiving theſe myſteries were ſtrengthened to undergo all that tyranny could lay upon them. Let them in like manner ſtrengthen us againſt all that Satan, and the world can do againſt us. And as the daily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of our body are helped by our bodily nouriſhment, ſo let our Infirmities of our ſouls by this our Spiritual nouriſhment be relieved, and us be ſatisfied and delighted therewith as with heavenly manna. O Lord, ſacrifice and offerings, and burnt offerings thou wouldeſt not have, but thou gaveſt a body to thy only begotten Son, that he ſhould offer up himſelf, in whom thou art well pleaſed. And this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was inſtituted by him in Commemoration of his death, and the acceptable Sacrifice of his life for the ſins of the world. Lord by his death and Sacrifice of his life unto thee, which we hereby celebrate, be reconciled unto us. This is that pure Sacrifice which the Saints ſhall offer up unto thee in every place.</p>
                  <p>LORD, ſince thou turneſt the malice of men, and the unjuſtice which they do thy Saints to the advantage either of their ſecular concerns, as <hi>Joſephs</hi> impriſonment was, or of their ſoules, Lord inable me to ſuffer wrong, and to take it patiently, to ſuffer railings and reviling as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Shemei</hi>'s railing, ſaying, If the Lord hath ſaid to <hi>Shemei,</hi> curſe <hi>David,</hi> who ſhall ſay,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34461:89"/>why haſt thou done ſo? So let him curſe, for who can tell whether the Lord will requite good for his railing. If I loath the fool in them, I muſt not act it my ſelf by returning the like. Let me conſider that by patience I poſſeſs my Soul, and that it is better to ſuffer wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, than as an evil doer, ſince it is the will of God that we ſhould ſuffer, and let our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be exerciſed hereby. And let us conſider him who endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lord, leſt we faint, and be weary in our mind, for the conſideration of his ſuffering ſuch reproach and the frequent remembrance of him hath efficacy, and vertue to ſtrengthen and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us, who are willing to be conformable to his ſufferings; but we had rather that this cup might paſs from us.</p>
                  <p>LORD whenever we fall into any ſin, we find im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately that we have loſt our own innocence, and thy favour; ſo that we cannot go about our affairs with that quietneſs, and peace, and ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mind as before we did, and in all that we do we fear it will have but bad ſucceſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we dare not look up to thee for a bleſſing. Lord, give us to conſider this, when we are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that we may fear ſin more, and make it out to our underſtandings, how we do by ſin crucify again unto our ſelves the Lord Jeſus, and put him to an open ſhame; for we are all ready to pronounce an Anathema upon the Crucifiers of our Lord; therefore let us not ſuffer theſe his Crucifiers to live.</p>

                     <hi>He that ſeeth in ſecret, he will reward thee openly.</hi> Let this encourage us to frequent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and duties. But O Lord our ſervices are
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:34461:90"/>ſo few and ſo ſlight, and perfunctory, and ſinful, while our hearts go after our covetouſneſs, and luſts, ſo that we forget before whom we are, and what we are doing, and ſo our duties are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, and our ſervices, provocations, ſins, vain oblations, abominations, filthy rags, like <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi>'s ſtrange fire, like the offering of the lame, and blind, when we have a male in our Flock, ſo that thou mayeſt juſtly deal with us, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did with the <hi>Gallilaeans,</hi> whoſe blood he mingled with their ſacrifice. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then can we expect? O Lord, we beſeech thee though our prayers are ſinful, yet accept them offer'd up in the Golden cenſer of Jeſus our Mediator, which is full of Incenſe, which are the Prayers of the Saints, and let theſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rags be waſh'd in his blood, and then they will be clean, and white as Snow, and then thou mayeſt reward them; but yet that reward is thy free mercy, therefore not unto us, O Lord, not unto us but to thy name is all the praiſe; for what can we do, for which thou ſhould'ſt reward us with ſo many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies here, and with life eternal? Any one of thy mercies is of more value then all our ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could deſerve or requite, if we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the duties of prayer, and praiſing thee night and day, all our lives, for we owe thee all we have, or can do. It is thine; as we are thy creatures, and we were but unprofitable Servants after we had done all we can, and we have need of an almighty Redeemer. Then let us not murmure if the Lord doth delay to hear us. Neither let us ſay, 'tis in vain to ſerve the Lord. Let us conſider alſo, that thou doſt delay
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34461:90"/>out of mercy, to try our patience, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and other graces, and to make us more ſervent, or may be becauſe thou wilt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us with temporal bleſſings, but eternal, which is far better, and let us not preſs, or be importunate to receive our reward here, leſt we go without the eternal reward, but let us be willing to truſt God, though he delay.</p>
                  <p>LET me not come near to that which may be a temptation, or if a temptation come upon me unawares, let me not ſay in my heart, I ſhall be ſtrong enough to reſit it, and ſo truſt to my own ſtrength; but let me have grace to obſerve thoſe ways, and methods of reſiſting ſin, as thou haſt appointed in thy word. Therefore let me fly immediately from the temptation as <hi>Joſeph</hi> fled from his Miſtreſs leaving his Cloak.</p>
                  <p>If by chance I fall into the Company of Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, let me not ſay, I ſhall preſerve my ſobriety, becauſe I love that, and hate that loathſom vice of beaſtly intemperance, but let me avoid them, and not look upon the Wine, when it moveth it ſelf right, and giveth a pleaſant colour in the Cup; or if it ſhould be ſo, that I have no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of my ſelf to this, or any other ſin, yet let me not therefore venture my ſelf upon the temptation, but let me fear ſin always, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how foully <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> fell; let me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be found ſtanding or walking in the way of ſinners, nor ſitting in their ſeat; but let me be always found in the way of God. And what is ſaid of the adulterous Woman, whoever touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her ſhall not be innocent; let me fear the ſame in every temptation, and avoid the leaſt medling with it, or approaches to it; and as it
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34461:91"/>is alſo ſaid concerning the ſame, avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it, paſs away; ſo let my practice be in all other temptations. And as it is ſaid of Gluttony, for remedy of it, if thou beeſt a man given to thy appetite, ſet a Knife to thy throat. So in all other temptations, let me lay violent hands upon the peccant member; if my right eye offend me, let me pluck it out. Lord, thou knoweſt that I am reſolved not to ſin to avoid the greateſt ſuffering, therefore teach me wiſdom that I may prevent and guard my ſelf againſt all provocations to ſin; that I may not draw upon my ſelf a neceſſity of ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>MAKE us to accept Jeſus Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our upon his own terms, as he offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us in the Holy Goſpel, to be our King, to rule us, and reign over us, our Prophet, to teach and inſtruct us, as well as to be our high Prieſt to attone and ſacrifice for our ſins. Let us not think to have the priviledges of Chriſtians, without the duties. Make it to be a greater pleaſure to us to deny our ſelves in ſins, then ever it was to give our ſelves up to them, that we may be meet to receive Heaven, into which fleſh and blood cannot enter. Let the Holy Spirit inflame us always with that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine fervent affection to God, that inſpired the Spouſe when ſhe ſaid, or ever I was aware, my Soul was like the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab.</hi> O ſweet Chriſt! do thou put grace into our hearts by that ſweet voice behind us, ſaying, this is the way, walk you in it; for thou only art our great Prophet and teacher who canſt make us learn, and our high Prieſt and mighty Saviour, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us from our ſins, and making us as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34461:91"/>by thy attonement, as if we had never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; for thoſe whom thou makeſt free, they are free indeed; if thou wilt not take away the being of ſin in us in this life, yet aſſiſt us with thy grace to ſubdue it deliver us out of the power of darkneſs, and the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And what benefits thou haſt purchaſed for us by thy death, apply them to us by thy interceſſion; deliver us from death, and give us the Crown of life, which thou haſt promiſed to all them that love thee; and ſince thou art deſirous of our ſalvation; and it is becauſe we will not come unto thee, that we have not life. O Chriſt, make us a willing people, as thou haſt promiſed, for our ſalvation is wholly from thee. But our damnation from our own wills, and if we periſh, our blood is upon our own heads. O ſweet Chriſt, our Prophet, and teacher, teach us by thy word, and thy Spirit the things that belong to our peace. Guide me by thy Spirit, and then bring me to glory.</p>
                  <p>LORD, what is there in us for which thou ſhouideſt deſire our love? Lord in thee is every thing that is lovely, therefore ought we to chuſe thee for the object of our love. But we ſeek that happineſs in the World, which we cannot find any where but in thee, and having found nought but emptineſs, vanity, and the loſs of all our labour in the purſuance of content, peace, and happineſs in the affaires, and matters of the world, let us at laſt betake our ſelves to ſeek it in thee, and thy waies; to learn of thee, to take thy yoak upon us, that we may find reſt to our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>LORD, what pretence can ſinners have for
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:34461:92"/>which they caſt off thy yoak, and will not have thee to rule over them, upon whoſe daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits they live? when they rebel againſt their Princes, and ſhake off their yoak, it is either for their leud lives and wickedneſs that they judge them unworthy to rule, therefore ſcorn to be ſubject unto them: Or for their oppreſſion that they are not able to bear their grievous burthens, but what iniquity have ſinners found in thee? thou haſt put the Queſtion to them, but they can find no anſwer.</p>
                  <p>LORD, ſince thou haſt ſhewed me that every Saint muſt live in the ſame holineſs of life that thy Servants the Apoſtles attained, and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaid of himſelf, that he was crucified with Chriſt, yet he lived, yet not he, but Chriſt lived in him, and he lived that life by the faith of Chriſt who gave himſelf for him; give us thy grace in like manner to crucify our ſelves to the World, and to live no more to it, nor to our ſelves but to live by Chriſt in us, ſo as we may be ſaid not to live. And if thou giveſt us to live the life of faith, and not to the World, and live to thee let us not impute this our well doing to our ſelves for of our ſelves we cannot think a good thought, but to Chriſt who liveth in us, who only can inable us thus to live.</p>
                  <p>In all our diſtreſſes, let us pray to the Lord, and uſe the meanes, as when the <hi>Arabians, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> and <hi>Aſhdodites</hi> conſpired againſt <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> 't is ſaid (<hi>Nehemiah.</hi> 4.9.) <hi>Nevertheleſs we made our prayer unto our God, and ſet a watch againſt them day and night.</hi> But let us not like King <hi>Aſa,</hi> ſeek to Phyſicians in our ſickneſs, and not to God.</p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:34461:92"/>
                  <p>LORD while I am ſupported by thy Spirit I ſhall be able to live blameleſly, as <hi>Lot</hi> did in the midſt of <hi>Sodom;</hi> but the ſtrongeſt of thy ſervants will fall as he afterwards did, if thou withdraw the Aſſiſtance of thy Spirit, and ſhall be as that Apoſtle: who denied the Lord Jeſus Chriſt whom before he ſought for, and reſolved to dye for, though he was the Rock. Therefore let me never be confident, leſt thou leaveſt me as thou didſt him. And when I hear of others miſcarriages, let me be thankful to thee for holding me up, and aſcribe it to thee, as the Angels in the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> are ſaid to caſt their Crowns at thy feet; and let us learn not to judge uncharitably of thoſe that are overcome by temptations.</p>
                  <p>LORD, when we pray unto thee, our prayers are ſo interrupted with worldly and ſinful thoughts; and the things we pray for being moſtwhat temporal mercies and deliverances from bodily evils, they are not ſuch prayers as our own reaſon can think worthy thy accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But Lord, though we offer thee the lame, and the blind (if we have no better in our flock, thou wilt accept it; therefore I will not ceaſe to pray unto thee, though I cannot approve my own prayers; for thus I come unto thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, or price, that thy gifts may be free.</p>
                  <p>O that I could account the corruption of my nature to be my miſery, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law of his members warring againſt the law of his mind; ſo that he could not do the good he would, cries out, <hi>Miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſin?</hi> And make me as ſenſible of the ſtrength of it as this holy man was.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:34461:93"/>
                  <p>LORD, if I fall into ſin, let me not be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it; as the adulterous woman, who eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and wipeth her mouth, and ſaith, <hi>I have done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>SINCE the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> wherein he was confident of his ſtrength above all others, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fell, I will aſcribe my ſtanding to God only, and praiſe him who holds me up: And pray with <hi>David, Lord, hold thou me up, and I ſhall be ſafe:</hi> And watch and take heed to my ſelf, and alwaies fear leſt I fall; ſince I know that I ſtand not by my own ſtrength; for corruption of nature is as ſtrong in me as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and the tempter the ſame to me as to them; but the Spirit of God only makes the difference; therefore I will praiſe God who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds me, and keeps my feet from falling; for it is not I that live the life of faith, but Chriſt that lives in me; therefore with the Elders in the <hi>Revelations, I will caſt my Glory and Crown at his feet, from whom I have received it.</hi> And the conſideration of this my weakneſs, ſhall teach me charity towards thoſe that are overcome with temptation, that I may reſtore them in the ſpirit of meekneſs; but not judge them, leſt I condemn my ſelf; as <hi>David</hi> did himſelf in the Parable of the yew Lamb: And as <hi>Judah</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

                  </p>
                  <p>LORD, eſtabliſh thou me with thy free Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereby I may ſtand in the hour of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and run, the ways of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments freely without rub or let: without dulneſs, and without danger of ſtumbling, or falling, that the Spirit may be willing, though the fleſh be weak. And with <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was full of the Spirit, he was content not only to be bound, but to die for Chriſt; ſo may I alſo ſince thou loveſt only the chearful giver. And as it ſaid, 5 of <hi>Judges.</hi> 9. <hi>Thy heart is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the governours of the people that offered themſelves willingly.</hi> So make me alwaies to caſt off readily and freely every tempter that goes about to ſeduce my affections from thee, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to harken to them.</p>
                  <p>LORD, give me to avoid not only groſs ſins, but alſo the ſmalleſt and firſt degrees of ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> To turn away my eyes from beholding vanity. Not to look upon the wine when it moves it ſelf right in the cup; to make a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with my eyes, not to look upon a maid, gives me underſtanding in the way of God that I may know theſe ſmall degrees of ſin to be ſins, and the danger of them, to avoid them, and all other of the like nature.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34461:94"/>making me think that I have more grace, than in truth I have, as <hi>Peters</hi> did him, ſo as that he thought, though all men denied thee, yet he ſhould not; or by making me think I have not thoſe corruptions that I have, as <hi>Haſael,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.13. When the Prophet told him what cruelties he would commit upon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> he anſwerd, <hi>is thy Servant a Dog?</hi> Yet did he commit the ſame; but let me know my own weakneſs, and vileneſs, that I may not truſt to my own ſtrength in any temptation, but let me rejoice in God my ſtrength, and know that thou art my ſtrength, and that thou only holdeſt me from falling, and keepeſt my feet from ſlipping, and ordereſt my goings, and makeſt me to run the waies of thy Commandments. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineſt my heart to thy teſtimonies. O hold thou me up, and I ſhall be ſafe.

And breakes out ſaying, though 10000 men ſhould ſet themſelves againſt me round about, yet will I not be afraid; and though as many Devils alſo are againſt me, let me not be afraid; let me remember thy promiſe, ſaying, call upon me in the time of trouble, &amp; I will deliver thee, and thou ſhaltpraiſe me. And let me not rely upon, nor truſt in the outward meanes, the arm of fleſh, though I do make uſe of it, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> whenhe builded the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſet watches, and they took their arms, with their ſpades, ſo wiſdom teacheth, but yet not to truſt to the Sword, or think that our bow ſhall help us, for ſo did that <hi>Philiſtine.</hi> Wherefore ſaid <hi>David</hi> thou comeſt to me with thy ſword, &amp; thy ſpear, but I come to thee, in the name of my God.</p>

                  <p>LORD, ſhew me how bountifully thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt every office which we do to thee; for as thou rewardedſt the Woman who poured the Balſom upon thy head with this honour, that whereever the Goſpel ſhould be preached, it ſhould be recorded of her; ſo doſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite, and reward every Cup of cold Water that is given for thy ſake: make me ſenſible of this, that my charity may not be ſo cold, as many times I feel it, nor my ſervices, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to thee, ſo few, and lukewarm, and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, but I may always abound in the work of the Lord. Make me willing, Lord, to ſuffer the reproach of Chriſt, and to endure that contempt which is uſually put upon holineſs, and the profeſſors of it. As <hi>David</hi> did when <hi>Michal</hi> ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed him for dancing before the Ark; as alſo when the rebukes of them who reproach thee, fellupon him. And again, he complained that the Judges, thoſe that ſate in the gate, ſpake againſt him, and the Drunkards made Songs on him. Accordingly as <hi>Jeremy</hi> alſo complained, ſaying, I am a Deriſion daily, every one mocks me. And the Apoſtles ſped no better, than when they had moſt of the Spirit, when the holy Ghoſt deſcended upon them, and they heard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſpeak in his own language; the ignorant people, ſaid, they were full of new wine. And our bleſſed Saviour when he caſt out the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34461:96"/>Devils, they blaſphemouſly ſaid, he did it by <hi>Belzebub,</hi> and he ſuffered, bearing the reproach of the ſhameful death of the Croſs. Let us be ſtrengthened by theſe examples, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that he hath pronounced them bleſſed whom men revile, and ſpeak all manner of evil of falſly for his name ſake: Conſidering that it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain we ſhall be reviled and ſlandered for his name ſake, and that our well bearing it is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to us of our ſoundneſs, and integrity in religion, ſince the hypocrite may be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his ſeeming holineſs, but rather than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the perſecution for it, will fall away. Since the men of this generation will not be laughed out of their gain, intereſts and callings, the aſſurance that we have of reigning, with Chriſt will make us willing to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>LORD, ſhew me the evil fruit, and ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of bad company that I may fly them. How that the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by being mingled with the Heathen, learned their works, for which they ſuffered. How that he that walks with the wiſe, ſhall be wiſe. But for <hi>David</hi> to dwell with <hi>Meſech,</hi> and in the Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> 'twas his calamity and woe, for 'tis ſaid in the word, that they ſleep not unleſs they do miſchief: But they are bleſſed who walk not in their council, nor ſtand in their way, nor ſit in their ſeat; and are the Companions of them that fear thee. Let me prefer ſolitude before vain Company, conſidering how it helps devotion, the Soul being free from thoſe divertiſments which ſuch company procures. So our Saviour ſeparated himſelf from company, when he prayed; and hath commanded us, when we pray, to enter
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:34461:96"/>into our Cloſets. So <hi>Peter</hi> went out from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and wept bitterly; and ſo in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> we are directed: Commune with your own heart in your Chamber, and be ſtill. So <hi>Iſaac</hi> walked forth to meditate. But in vain and lewd Company, the righteous Soul cannot but be grieved with their unclean converſation. It is a Hell to thy Servants, as the Worldly mans converſation is a burthen; they are ſo buſy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout many affairs, that they mind not <hi>Mary's</hi> choice: but to be in thy Courts one day is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a thouſand. <hi>I had rather be a Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in the houſe of my God, than to dwell in the Tents of ungodlineſs,</hi> Pſal. 84.10, 11.</p>
                  <p>LET not my confeſſion be without contrition, leſt it prove but as <hi>Sauls,</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi>'s, but as <hi>Peters</hi> was when he went out and wept bitterly, which will the better be effected, if I take the preſent time, as he immediatly when he heard the Cock crow, went out; for the Devil deceives us with promiſes of future repentance that he may ſteal away the preſent opportunity. Therefore we are commanded to exhort one another while it is called to day: remembring the unhappy condition of the Cripple at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> who had none to help him into the water when it was moved, till another got before him; and <hi>Felix</hi> (in the <hi>Acts</hi>) trembling at the preaching of <hi>Paul,</hi> put him off for a farther hearing, to a more convenient time. But to day is the time to hear thy voice. And if thou call'ſt, and we will not hear, then we ſhall call, and thou wilt not hear. While God calls, one tear will do us more good, than an Ocean of tears, when it is too late. And for what uſe hath God given man
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34461:97"/>his tears, but to weep for his ſins; then let us with <hi>David,</hi> make our Tears not our Phyſick, but our meat, and drink, which we cannot do, if we extenuate our ſins, or excuſe them.</p>
                  <p>LORD, if thou goeſt not forth with our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we are put to ſhameful flight. If thou aſſiſt us not in our callings, our labouurs are but in vain: except the Lord keep the City, the Watch-man watcheth in vain. In vain we riſe early, and go late to bed, except the Lord give us his bleſſing. Therefore will we ſeek the Lord, and his bleſſing, upon our Labours. And though we find no worth in our prayers, for which the Lord ſhould hear them, or reward them, but puniſh us for them, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is his command that we ſhould offer up our weak ſervices to him, and he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to hear us for the things we ask for in his Sons name, and in obedience to that command. And in the faith we give to his promiſe, we ſeek to him, to aſſiſt us, and to let his preſence go with us. For the Lord hath ſhewed us by frequent experiences; That thoſe who have moſt means, do not ſeldom miſs their purpoſe, or if they by Gods bleſſing do attchieve their purpoſes, yet it is frequently without the uſe of thoſe means, by ſome accident; that it might be ſeen to be of God, and not of man, and our unbelief be convinced. Praiſe the Lord, O my Soul, who hath often brought to paſs my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires without any conſiderable means by me u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>And all that is within me praiſe his holy name,</hi> becauſe he hath accepted my two Mites, my worthleſs Prayers; <hi>for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>

                  <p>When I am tempted to any ſin, let me conſider how I have loathed my ſelf heretofore when I have been overcome by any luſt or ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. If I have at any time yielded to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of any of my ſenſes, which is all that the world can offer; though it hath been but to a very ſmall degree, as to drink one glaſs more than the neceſſity of nature, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent refreſhing required; for though it makes not drunkenneſs, yet it ſets the mind too much at liberty from that ſtrictneſs and watchfulneſs, that mortification, and crucifying the fleſh, and ſelf-denial that the Scripture requires; or if I give way to a luſtful thought, or glance, or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereby my mind is carried to effeminate meditations from the more ſerious and virtuous conſiderations which an honeſt mind ſhould me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, how do I ſeem ſordid to my ſelf, and degraded from my priſtine excellency. And though the perſon whoſe beauty, excellency, and perfections drew me aſide thereto be incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet when I conſider the baſeneſs of the laſt acts of luſt, and fruition, to which all this tends, and ſerves, how poorly do I think of all thoſe allurements of beauty, and parts, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, wit, and other excellencies, ſince they are the motives and incentives to concupiſcence. And I no ſooner perceive, that I have yeilded too much to any temptation of luſt, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, or any other whatſoever, but I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently perceive that my honour is gone from me; or if I know of any other who hath yeilded to any temptation, I think the ſame of them.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34461:98"/>All theſe arguments, and reaſons are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to reſtrain from relapſing into the very ſame offences, and ſenſualities; for ſenſe with one glance of the eye captivates the affections in a moment, whereas reaſon and ſtrength of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prevails only upon deliberation; ſo that I cannot expect to ſtand by my own ſtrength, unleſs thou Lord holdeſt me up I ſhall fall one day by theſe my ſpiritual enemies. And it is by thy power only that we are kept from the evil of the World. Therefore as the eyes of a Servant are to the hands of his Maſter, ſo ſhall my eyes be to thee. And I will continually pray unto thee, for ſupportation, and ſtrength, ſince thy ſtrength is perfected in our weakneſs: why then ſhould my weakneſs diſcourage me? and for grace, and faith in thy promiſes, ſince grace alone is ſufficient for us: and faith alone is the victory whereby we may overcome the World, that by faith I may look upon the infinite joyes of Heaven, and contemn the vain and baſe joyes of this life, or elſe be terrified with the horrid torments thou haſt threatned to the diſobedient, and fear to do evil.</p>
                  <p>LET me think it greater pleaſure to reſiſt luſt, or any ſenſuality, than to yield to it; for if I reſiſt, I ſatisfy and delight my reaſon, which delights in manly, noble, reſolute acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in eſchewing the contrary <hi>viz.</hi> Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, ſenſual pleaſures, which the mind doth oppoſe, and diſdain as brutiſh, and below it, for how is it poſſible that the mind ſhould be ſatisfied, contented, or delighted with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and delights of the ſenſes, any more then the ſenſes can enjoy, or take delight in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34461:98"/>of the mind or intellect, ſince the ſenſes are of the Brutiſh nature of the meaneſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, and the mind and underſtanding is of the divine nature of the Creator, and ſince the Saints are ſaid to be made partakers of the Divine nature, let us endeavour to partake of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, by holineſs of life. And if we have received Chriſt in his teaching and in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſupper to walk in him, that our life may grow out of the death of Chriſt. Not to be unprofitable Servants, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſaid to be, an empty vine, but let us be ever ſowing the fruits of righteouſneſs, that we may reap accordingly, and be ſtudious to know the things which belong to our peace before they be hid from our eys, and to do them too, leſt thou remove our light from us, remembring that if we be like the dry, and unprofitable chaff, we ſhall be burned with unquenchable fire. But the Goſpel bringeth forth fruit in all the World, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 6.1.</p>
                  <p>LORD, if thou doſt but ſeem to have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me, ſo that when I think of thee I dont per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive comfort, but fear, though I have all the outward comforts and all the pleaſures which the World can afford, I am in horror in the midſt of my pleaſures, I will therefore walk in the waies of righteouſneſs, for her waies are waies of peace, and all her pathes pleaſantneſs; and this will bring a man peace at the laſt. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that do righteouſneſs alwaies, they walk with thee, and have ſweet communion with thee, and thou wilt come in, and ſup with them, and abide with them; then hath their ſoul fulneſs of joy, but I fear I grieve thy holy
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34461:99"/>Spirit continually in this, that I am carnal, and do not live by faith above the World; Lord, that I could live as thoſe whoſe converſation is in Heaven, whoſe treaſure is there, and they are always adding to this treaſure, who are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually wiſe, whoſe hearts are fixed upon thee, and go not aſtray as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> did in the wilderneſs, forgetting God their Saviour, who had done wonders for them; but they thought not of his hand, nor remembered what wonders he had wrought for them, but luſt came upon them in the deſert, wherefore the Lord thought to have deſtroyed them, had not <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood in the gap to turn away his wrath.</p>
                  <p>If we in like manner forget thy mercys and require meat for our luſts, we fear thy wrath will be kindled againſt us to deſtroy us, but we truſt that we have a greater than <hi>Moſes,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, to turn away thy wrath by his offering up his life as a ranſom for us, and bearing the iniquities of us all. Let my life be hid with Chriſt in God, that when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, we alſo may appear with him in Glory. Lord, let me remember how ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the righteous are ſaved, and with what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty as it were by the gates of Hell, how difficulty St. <hi>Paul</hi> keept his body under, fearing leſt while he preached to others himſelf ſhould become a reprobate; and give me that ſpiritual puiſſance and holy fortitude to bear my ſelf undaunted with difficulties in the heavenly warfare.</p>
                  <p>O Lord God, my afflictions are ſometimes full of horror, they ſeem to come from the ſame juſtice by which thou caſteſt the wicked into
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:34461:99"/>Hell. And they are to me like Hell; whilſt they ſo diſmay and terrifie me, and thou ſeemeſt to have forſaken me in my afflictions and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and I have no hope that thou wilt ever remove them, but that thou haſt ſent them to confound me. And I can hardly refrain from the expreſſion of the wicked <hi>Cain</hi> That my afflictions are greater than I am able to bear. And being at my wits end, I am afraid that thou wilt not enable me to bear them, and haſt rejected me as thou didſt <hi>Saul,</hi> and haſt taken thy holy Spirit from me, and that thou art mine enemy, &amp; I fear I am unreconciled to thee becauſe I don't feel filial affections to thee when thou chaſtiſeſt me; neither do I ſay thou haſt chaſtiſed me leſs then I deſerve, but I am ready to murmure, and to have hard thoughts, to think it more than I deſerve, becauſe I think it grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any other mans affliction; alſo becauſe I find thou haſt been more ready to hear the prayers of others for deliverances, than thou art to hear mine: As that of <hi>Hanna,</hi> when ſhe was deſpiſed for barrenneſs, ſhe prayed to thee once, and thou heardeſt her, and her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was no more ſad. And at the third time thou anſweredſt <hi>Paul,</hi> when he deſired to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the thorn in the fleſh, and didſt give him grace ſufficient for the temptation: But as for me, I mourn, being deſolate, and take no comfort night and day, and thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeſt not. But now that I conſider that the man who was according to thine own heart, (when he had grieved the holy Spirit) as I pray God I never more may do, cryed out as I do, <hi>The pains of Hell came about me, the ſnares of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34461:100"/>death overtook me. Take not thy holy Spirit rom me.</hi> And again, <hi>From my youth up thy terrors have I ſuffered with a troubled mind.</hi> And, <hi>a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible trembling hath overwhelmed me.</hi> And, <hi>My confuſion is daily before me, and the ſhame of my face hath covered me.</hi> I take it to be the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints, to be much afflicted; and to go to Heaven by the gates of Hell.</p>
                  <p>O ſhew me, Lord, wherein I may enjoy my ſelf, and find ſatisfaction, and content without remorſe, regret, or ſubſequent ſadneſs. If it be in any action or contemplation of mine, it muſt be in religious duties, when I ſerve thee with a quiet, undiſtracted, well compoſed ſpirit, and am ſenſible that I enjoy thy favour, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. But certain I am, that I could never enjoy my ſelf ſo as not to be ſenſible of empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, unprofitableneſs, weariſomneſs, unſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorineſs, deſire of change, tediouſneſs, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and vexation. In all thoſe things which the natural man can do, think, or ſpeak, or enjoy, unleſs the Spirit directs me in them to ſpiritual ends, to the honour and glory of God. This therefore makes a clear conviction, That the happineſs of man, and the end for which he was made, is to glorify God in keeping his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments with an upright heart. And to love him with all the ſoul, herein only can man find true joy, content, peace, reſt, quiet, ſatisfaction and injoyment for his ſoul. Let me be always ſatisfied, delighted and raviſhed with theſe joys; let my ſoul be ſatisfied as with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and fatneſs, when my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips; let me ſit under thy ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow with delight, and let thy fruit be pleaſant
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34461:100"/>to my taſt, even thine only, and let me be ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the joys of thy houſe; let the breaſts of thine ordinances ſatisfy me at all times; let me be always raviſhed with thy love. With joy let me draw water out of the wells of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and make me joyful in the houſe of prayer. Let my ſoul thirſt for thee, and my fleſh long after thee, even <hi>as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>art panteth after the water Brooks, ſo let my ſoul long after thee, my God.</hi> Let my delight be in thee, and in thoſe rivers of pleaſure that are at thy right hand for ever more. Let me ſet me ſet my affections on things above, where Chriſt Jeſus ſitteth at the right hand of God for ever, and take of my affections from things below, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and let it be above. Let all my freſh ſprings be in thee, at midnight let me riſe and give thanks unto thee becauſe of thy righteous judgments. Let me be a companion of all them that fear thee, and keep thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Let me be aſſured of thy love to me by all thy ſpiritual and temporal mercys and means of grace, and hope of glory. And let me be aſſured of my reciprocal love to thee by my willing obedience to all thy commandments. That I may know that my beloved is mine, and I am his. And if at any time thou heareſt my prayer, and granteſt my requeſt; let me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate thoſe things unto thee, which I obtain by prayer, as <hi>Hanna</hi> did her Son. O Bleſſed Lord Jeſus, theſe ſweet kiſſes are better than wine.</p>
                  <p>SINCE all who will live Godly muſt ſuffer perſecution, and it is ſaid that if we ſuffer with
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34461:101"/>him, we ſhall alſo reign with him, prepare, fit and ſtrengthen me to undergo all the troubles and afflictions of this day, and of the whole courſe of my life which Satan, and the wicked, and ungodly men of the World ſhall contrive againſt me. And let me expect every day affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for Chriſts ſake, and reproach, and a croſs, and trouble in this World, ſince our Hope is not in this World, but is reſerved for us in Heaven; and in this World we are to be of all men moſt miſerable; therefore let me not expect beds of roſes here, but to go through many tribulations, and a fiery trial; patiently waiting for the time when the Lord ſhall tread down Satan under our feet: And when the Lord ſhall avenge the blood of the ſouls that lye ſlain, under the Altar, crying for vengeance upon the inhabitance of the earth, remembring that none of all theſe things ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus, but we ſhall be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors over them through Chriſt Jeſus. And let me not be offended at the Croſs of Chriſt, knowing that the Goſpel is offer'd upon the termes of ſelf-denial, and taking up our Croſs, and knowing that thou doſt comfort thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in all afflictions, and that as their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions do abound, their conſolations do much more abound; but rather let us count it all joy when we fall into theſe temptations, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they work in us patience, experience, hope and repentance. So <hi>David</hi> before he was affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted he went aſtray but by his afflictions learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Judgments, and he ſaid, 'tis good for me that I have been afflicted. And my afflictions
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:34461:101"/>ſeem not greater than his when he cried out, <hi>Thy hand is heavy upon me day and night, my moiſture is like the drought in ſummer. All the day long am I afflicted, and chaſtned every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am dried up, and my heart is like the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wax, my heart panteth, my ſtrength faileth me, and the light of my eyes is gone from me; my lovers, and my friends ſtand afar off, and no man cares for my ſoul. But Lord, I will make my prayers unto thee in an acceptable time, and call upon thee in the time of my trouble. Lord, how long ſhall mine enemies triumph over me, Lord, when wilt thou comfort me? Lord, as others have found thee full of compaſſion, and mercy, ſo let me find. Think upon thy compaſſions which have been ever of old. Remember not against me mine iniquitys, but do away my ſins for thy names ſake.</hi>

                  <p>I don't enough apprehend my proneneſs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſin, and luſt, but think my ſelf free from ſin, and from the danger of falling, becauſe I feel it not ſtirring for the preſent, whereas the reaſon why it is ſo, is only becauſe various di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions take up my thoughts otherways, and keep out thoſe, ſo that they are but only laid aſleep as it were, and are eaſily awaked by any temptation, if the Lord don't ſtrengthen me, and the leaſt opportunity lets them looſe upon me, ſo that I am not able to reſiſt them. Lord, let me watch againſt all thoſe ſins that I find my nature inclined to, and againſt ſuch as I find no inclination to, but an utter averſation from, becauſe my nature is wholly corrupted, and it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34461:102"/>is the power of God only, that keeps me from all ſorts of ſins, and temptations; therefore let me fear every temptation, and ſin, and watch againſt them, and pray that I enter not into any temptation, for if I once but enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the temptation; I am ſure to fall if I have no better ſupport than my own ſtrength; though the temptation be but weak, my ſtrength is weaker.

                  <p>Lord, when I confeſs my ſins which I have comitted againſt ſo many means of grace, thy mercies, Judgments, promiſes, Threatnings the teſtimonies of my own conſcience, of thy holy Spirit, and the teſtimonies of the wicked alſo, I muſt needs acknowledg thy juſtice in all my puniſhments, and thy long ſuffering in this, that thou doſt not confound me, nor quite caſt me off, as thou didſt <hi>Saul,</hi> but puniſhedſt me leſs than I deſerve. And I admire thy goodneſs in this, that in the midſt of thy wrath thou remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereſt mercy, and haſt delivered me, when in my affliction I ſought thee; herein I rejoice; and I beſeech thee Lord make me contented to be reſtrain'd from ſin by ſorrow. Lord, thou art my God, and my Lord; therefore let me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg thee in all my ways; wait upon thee, ſerve and obey thee; and let me not live as if I were without a God, nor according to my own luſts, denying the Lord that bought me, as thoſe do who make their belly their God, or

Thou art to thy Servants, their hope, and ſtrength, and preſent help in trouble; therefore let not the ſurpriſe of any trouble diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may me, as if I were hopeleſs or helpleſs; thou art the Defender of all them that put their truſt in thee, mighty to ſave, God all-ſufficient, therefore let me walk with thee, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. O thou who art the Rock of ages, the helper of the poor, and fatherleſs, helpleſs, and deſtitute. The Fountain of living water. Let me always run unto thy fountain for true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, not to broaken Ciſterns. Let not the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my nature, or my ſins diſmay me, for thou knoweſt whereof we are made; but let me look up to Chriſt, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being ſtung, did to the brazen Serpent, and be healed; Let me taſte of the Tree of life in the midſt of the paradiſe of God, &amp; live, even the body and blood Jeſus Chriſt, as oft a I eat of this Tree of life in the bleſſed communion aſſure, me that I am healed of all my paſſed ſins. Thou Lord art life and truth, I will therefore be guided by thee, believe in thee, and be dead to the World, and all creatures, and live unto thee, and upon
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34461:103"/>thee. In Chriſt let us have life, even the new life of the life of faith, and not of ſenſe. That the old man may dye daily. That Chriſt may live in us, as the head liveth in the members, and we in him by faith in the promiſes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life through him: As <hi>Abraham</hi> did in the Land of promiſe, though he had not as yet received the earthly promiſe, neither did he ſet his heart upon it, nor ſeek it, or ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be hindred by it in the perſuit of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture felicity.

                  <p>As thou art the God of our ſtrength and therefore we need not to go mourning through fear of the enemy; ſo art thou our exceeding joy, whereby we are holily tranſproted to rejoyce in thee in ſinging thy praiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. <hi>Praiſe the Lord O my ſoul and all that is within me, Praiſe his holy name, Pſal.</hi> 103</p>

                  <p>As thou art gracious, and merciful, patient, ſlow to anger, ready to forgive the ſins of thy people for thy names ſake, ſo art thou alſo righteous in all thy waies, and holy in thy works. If a man will not turne, thou wilt whet thy ſword, and bend thy bow, thou wilt bring upon ſuch all the curſes written in thy book till thou haſt deſtroyed them, for ſo thou haſt done to thine own people the <hi>Jews,</hi> who would not believe thy threatnings to be warned thereby. Thou who ſhewedſt mercy to <hi>Niniveh</hi> repenting, after the judgment pronounced, and to <hi>Ahab</hi> going mournefully when he heard the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned againſt his houſe, (which ſhews that thy threatnings are conditional, <hi>viz.</hi> if we turn not) thou likewiſe laideſt thy hand ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon thy Servant <hi>David,</hi> day and night, that his moiſture was like the drought in ſummer. The light of his eyes was gone from him, he was almoſt conſumed by means of thy heavy hand, he had no health in his bones, nor no ſoundneſs in his fleſh, his teares was his meat day and night. All the day long was he puniſhed and chaſtened every morning, becauſe his iniquities were gone over his head; theſe and many more as <hi>Eli, Lot,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> are ſet out in the word for examples of the truth of thy threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin though repented of. Give me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy grace that I may watch againſt ſin, and all temptations, and occaſions thereof, and againſt the leaſt degrees and beginnings of ſin, and all appearance of evil, with prayer that I entter not into temptation, and the Lord ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me, and hold me up that I fall not in temptations. And when I pray unto thee in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34461:104"/>the name of Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour for pardon for my manifold ſins. O Lord, remember that thou haſt declared thy ſelf to be the Lord, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and merciful, ſlow to anger, that forgiveſt the iniquities of thy people for thy name ſake, and let thy mercy be magnified by the greatneſs of my ſins: my ſins are more in number than the hairs of my head. But thy mercys as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, thy thoughts are not like our thoughts. <hi>For as far as the Heaven is above the earth, ſo far are thy thoughts above our thoughts.</hi> And let the greatneſs of my Redeemers merits be magnified by the greatneſs of my unworthineſs. He is mighty to ſave. And though our ſins be as ſcarlet, he can make us white as ſnow, by his blood which he hath ſhed for us; for if he be Lord of all, and the World was made by him, then was he able alſo to reedeem all the World that come unto God by him for redemption; do thou but aſſure me that the leaſt drop of his blood, the leaſt ſigh of his heart, or the leaſt degree of his humiliation, was for my ſins, or had reſpect unto me among the reſt, and I do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly believe they are fully pardoned, and I am ſaved from all the curſe that is due unto them.</p>
                  <p>Lord, ſince thou haſt imputed to him my ſins, for it is ſaid that he hath born the Iniquities of us all, it is but juſt with thee, that I ſhould be acquitted, and have his rightoeuſneſs imputed to me, elſe why did he ſuffer?</p>
                  <p>LET us then be made the righteouſneſs of God in him, ſince he was (for that end, and purpoſe) made ſin for us, ſince thou haſt given him for a covenant to the people, give us alſo
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34461:104"/>to find in our ſelves that we have him, and with him all thoſe promiſes of grace that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this covenant which in him are verified and fulfilled. With him therefore give us thy Spirit in our hearts to cauſe us to walk in thy ſtatutes, to know, and do thy judgements; cauſe us to love thee with all our hearts to delight in thee, and to fear thee, to run and not be weary, and to be holy in all our common things &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>LORD, teach us with thy bleſſed Apoſtles <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> to ſing Pſalmes in the mideſt of the Dungeon, and with the three children, when the furnace is made three times hotter than at other times. And that we may have perfect patience, make us ſenſible that the hand of God is upon us for our ſins deſervedly, as the thief upon the croſs was. If we have no ſucceſs either in our ſpiritual or Worldly affaires, let us believe that it is the hand of God for our ſins: That we have not made better uſe of the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which God hath laid upon us, to purge us of ſome ſin, and do not ſearch out the cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and try our waies, it is our ſin, for his hand is ſtreched out ſtill; for if we know that God chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, and ſcourges every Son whom he loveth, we may then underſtand that with one judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment God puniſheth us for the ſins paſſed, and delivereth us thereby from ſin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for the time to come. As when his Servant <hi>David</hi> had ſinned by numbering the people, God ſent the Prophet to him to declare his will to puniſh him with one of thoſe three evils, he cried, I have ſinned, ſo that whereever ſin is, there God deteſts and puniſheth. <hi>The
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34461:105"/>righteous ſhall not go unpuniſhed.</hi> But the Sons of <hi>Ely</hi> when their Father reproved them for their ſins, 'tis ſaid, <hi>They hearkned not becauſe the Lord would deſtroy them.</hi> Therefore it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that it was a toaken of Gods Fatherly love to <hi>David</hi> that he puniſhed him for his ſin, that he might repent of them, and not lye in them, and die in them. But whom God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to run on in ſin without any croſſes, and afflictions, rebukes and chaſtiſements, they are none of his children. Another reaſon why God afflicts his children, is to take their hearts from off the love of the world, that we may uſe the world as if we uſed it not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 45. <hi>I bring evil upon all fleſh, and ſeekeſt thou great things. If any one loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> But when we are in proſperity, we ſay as holy <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. <hi>Tuſh, I ſhall never be caſt down,</hi> but it followeth, <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled;</hi> he then ſees his weakneſs, and vanity, and too much ſecurity which he expreſſed in his proſperity, the Lord was pleaſed to withdraw the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that he might not ſet his affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, nor rejoice in the things of the world, but in the enjoiment of God, and live upon that.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider that God doth ſuffer his people to be afflicted for the exerciſe of their graces, as he did <hi>Jobs</hi> patience, hope, faith, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fortitude, and his other graces, <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. <hi>Though the Lord ſhould kill me, yet would I truſt in him,</hi> ſaid he in his affliction, <hi>James</hi> 1.23. <hi>Count it all joy when you fall into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Knowing that the tryal of your faith worketh
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34461:106"/>patience. Solomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Chaſten thy Son, and thou ſhalt have comfort of him;</hi> ſo doth our heavenly Father; ſo that to the faithful, afflictions ſhould be cauſe of joy, becauſe they are the means of grace. The worſt creature that ever was, will oftentimes make as great a ſhow as the beſt in proſperity: ſilver is tried in the fire: conſider God never laid any thing upon his children, but he gave them ſtrength to ſuffer it, or did miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the pain; <hi>He ſtaieth his rough wind in the day of the eaſt wind, Iſa.</hi> 27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt him in thy law.</hi>

                  <p n="13">13. <hi>That thou maieſt give him patience in time of adverſity until the pit be digged up for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34461:106"/>ſcorn, and contempt of my meaner brethren in my heart, or be inclined to revile ſuch as have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, I may juſtly fear, that though thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved one judgment from me, yet thou wilt bring another greater upon me, and if I will not be thereby humbled, and taught to bear with the infirmities of my brethren, ſo as to pitty, reſtore, and help them, thou mayeſt juſtly heap more, and more plagues upon me, and mine till thou haſt deſtroyed me. And ſince thou haſt ſaid, that the ſame meaſure that we meet to others ſhall be meaſured to us again, Teach me that I may forbear all diſtaſtful words, and ſcornful behaviour, and all paſſion, and cenſure towards others, that are under me, though but my Servants, leaſt thoſe who are above me, or under me, ſhould requite me with the like. If thou ſuffereſt me to be railed at, and reviled, as thy Servant <hi>David</hi> was often, and as all holy men of God, and Saints have been, and muſt expect to be, let me not look upon the perſons ſo railing, but receive it as from God, as he did, ſaying if the Lord hath ſaid to <hi>Shimei,</hi> curſe <hi>David,</hi> who ſhall ſay why haſt thou done ſo. So let him curſe, for who can tell but the Lord will requite good for his railing, and ſo the Lord did requite it, and let me learn not to judge others, by what they ſuffer but conſider the bitter mockings which the Diſciples of Chriſt underwent, as the Lord had foretold them; but chiefely let us conſider what contradiction of ſinners our bleſſed Lord and Saviour underwent, leſt we faint in our minds, and be weary.

                  <p>IN their Affliction they will ſeek me early. When by Affliction we are deprived of all worldly comfort, then we will ſeek it in God; therefore it is neceſſary for ſome people to be alwaies afflicted, and I may be one of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10, 11.

Now no chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the preſent ſeemeth joyous, but grievous, nevertheleſs afterwards it yeldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs unto them that are exerciſed thereby.</hi> So that the end of Gods Afflicting us, is to improve our faith, patience, holineſs, and other graces, and he will make theſe means ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.9.</p>

                  <p>O My ſoul, let not lying lips, ſlanders, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings, nor falſe accuſations provoke thee to let looſe the reins to revenge and wrath, but rather give place to injuries, leſt thou juſtifieſt the Sons of <hi>Zerviah,</hi> ſaying let us cut off this dogs head, and condemneſt holy <hi>David.</hi> And thou mayeſt hope for the like requital if thou do accordingly, but thou hadſt rather that the Lord would keep thee ſecretly in his Tabernacle from ſtrife of tongue.</p>
                  <p>Another end why God afflicts his people, is to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34461:107"/>make them like to Chriſt, as it is 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12.

                  <p>The third end is the trial of faith, as the St. <hi>Peter</hi> 6.7. <hi>Though now ye are in heavineſs (if need be) through manifold temptations,</hi> 7 <hi>v.

                  <p>O my ſoul, let thy impatiente bearing of lyings, ſlanders, backbitings, and falſe accuſations humble thee, and drive thee to ſeek to God by prayers, and tears, to aſſiſt and help thy weak patience, and faith, and make thee more conformable to Chriſt, thou canſt bear other injuries, learn to bear theſe, that thou mayeſt be bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>O my God, do thou preſerve me, ſupport me, and hold me up, that I may not fall by wrath, and impatience, though the injuries I receive be never ſo great, unjuſt and falſe, yet let me be ſupported by thy word, and thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in me aſſuring me of reward in heaven. O my God, let me contentedly ſubmit to thy chaſtiſments, and let me be aſſured that thou
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34461:108"/>wilt bring good out of evil, and that they are ſent by thee for my good, that I ſhould not be condemned with the world, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) And by thy aſſiſtance I ſhall go forth to thee without the camp bearing thy reproach, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.14. And my patience ſhall be perfected. And aſſure me that in this unjuſt ſuffering I take up the Croſs of a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Another end why God afflicts us, is to make us call to mind our ſins which procured the afflictions, as <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren called to mind theirs of ſelling their brother. It makes us to ſearch, and try our ſelves what ſins we lye in, and have not repented off.</p>

               <div type="meditation">
                  <head>Meditation.</head>
                  <p>LORD, Sanctify them to us for this end, that we may not lye in our ſins, nor dye in them. But may be awakened, to ſearch and try our waies, and call to mind our ſins and repent of them with a godly ſorrow, unto ſalvation, and turne unto the Lord with all our hearts, leſt otherwiſe we periſh with the world. And let the bleſſedneſs which thou haſt pronounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy mourners, and the comfort which thou haſt promiſed them, come on them in the ſight of their perſecutors, for their comfort will be the diſcomfort of them.</p>
                  <p>Another end why Gods afflicts us, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us from ſome ſin which we are prone to, ſo he reſtrained St. <hi>Paul</hi> from pride; for if God did not reſtrain us, we ſhould fall oftener than we do, not only into thoſe ſame ſins which we have formerly committed, but alſo into all
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34461:108"/>others which the nature of man is ſubject to commit, and which we think our ſelves quite free from, as <hi>Haſael,</hi> when the Prophet told him what <hi>Villanies</hi> he would commit, anſwered him, ſaying. <hi>Thinkeſt thou that thy Servant is a Dog?</hi> yet he did what the Prophet had foretold, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8. So God withheld <hi>Abimeleck</hi> from ſinning with <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife; ſo <hi>David,</hi> before he was afflicted he went aſtray, but learned Gods judgments by afflictions. And ſaid, <hi>Thy Rod and thy Staff have comforted me.</hi> by which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>David</hi> it appeares, That another end of Afflictions is for Spiritual comfort. Therefore 'tis ſaid in St. <hi>James, Count it all joy when you fall into manifold temptations;</hi> For as ſin, as ſoon as committed flies in our face, and tells us that we have deſerved all the curſes threatned in Gods word, for our conſciences immediately tels us that the wages of ſin are death, and damnation; ſo afflictions brings to mind our ſins, and makes our conſciences ſearch themſelves what ſins lye unrepented off. Then our repentance, brings remiſſion, and peace of conſcience, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, and watchfulneſs, and carefulneſs againſt ſin for the future. But to make us more capable of the comfort, it ſeems meet to God to viſit us by afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Another end of afflictions it to abaſe and humble us. That we may walk humbly with our God: humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may lift you up; where both theſe ends of afflictions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, <hi>viz.</hi> The joy of being lifted up, with the humiliation; he humbles whom he in tends to exalt.</p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:34461:109"/>
                  <p>Another end is for purgation. I will purge away all the droſs, and tinn. Which doth ſupoſe that there are ſome ſins committed by, and ſome corruptions remaining in the Servants of God, as it is in the 9 of <hi>Daniel</hi> 11. <hi>Yea, all Iſrael have tranſgreſſed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice, therefore the curſe is poured upon us, and the oath that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the law of Moſes, becauſe we have ſinned. Every branch in me that beareth fruit he purgeth, Iſa.</hi> 27.9. <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of jacob be purged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As our Saviour was made perfect by ſuffering, ſo all that are made perfect, are made perfect by ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>When our conſciences checks us, it cauſes us to ſearch, and try our waies, as it is in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>after I was afflicted, I ſmote upon my thigh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another end to bring a man to himſelf, when before he would not know himſelf, nor could underſtand his frailties and weakneſs; alſo to bring a man to Chriſt, and to make him go out of himſelf, and the thought of his ſelf-ſufficiency, and ſelf confidence, to ſeek his ſalvation in Chriſt alone; for if the word doth not work upon us, God doth work by the Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, upon hard conſciences, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, my reines chaſten me in the night ſeaſon. So was the Prodigal Son brought to himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think him of his Fathers houſe, and to return home.</p>
                  <p>LORD, ſanctify them to thy Servant for all theſe ends, that I may find all thoſe opperations wrought in me, and let me wait patiently upon the Lord, laying my mouth in the duſt. As water
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:34461:109"/>that ſtands ſtill without motion or agitation putrifieth; and the Air corupteth unleſs it be moved with ſome gales of Wind; ſo the minds of men become degenerate, and their virtues, and graces ſoon languiſh, unleſs they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and exerciſed by variety of fortune, troubles, and new difficulties; the moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome accidents that befall, teach and improve a wiſe man moſt, and learn him the beſt leſſons. Time of Trouble is the ſeaſon for Prayer. If <hi>Eſau</hi> had not come againſt <hi>Jacob</hi> with an army, he had not wreſtled with God, nor got the bleſſing. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call upon me in the time of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt praiſe me:</hi> ſo it is the ſeaſon for Gods mercy to thoſe who ſeek it by prayer,</p>
                  <p>And as if the ſenſe of our neceſſities would not force us enough to this duty of prayer, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes it by precept, and inviteth with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which ſhews both our backwardneſs to the Duty, and Gods readineſs to accept our prayers, and ſhew mercy to us; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is fain to be found of them that ſeek him not, and he is fain to ſend his Spirit to help us to pray; and ſometimes he is fain to hear us when we have but a purpoſe to pray, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid in the Pſalms, <hi>I ſaid I wll confeſs my ſin, and thou forgaveſt my iniquities,</hi> and ſometimes God is fain to prevent us, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.10. <hi>Before they call, I will anſwer;</hi> and ſometimes he will not ſtay till the end of our Prayer (as it is ſaid) Whileſt they cry, I will ſay, here am I. So the Lord ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.21. I have ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaning himſelf; ſo, whilſt <hi>Daniel</hi> was praying, at the beginning of his Prayer
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34461:110"/>God anſwered, <hi>Dan,</hi> 9. the Prodigal deſired to be but as a hired Servant, and the Father brings forth the Fatted Calf to entertain him; ſo God gives us more than we ask.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is any man afflicted, let him pray;</hi> it teacheth that Gods Children are not free from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, nor can expect ſo to be. It teacheth alſo that thoſe prayers that are extorted from us by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity are heard, neceſſity, may firſt ſet men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work to pray as it did <hi>Jacob.</hi> Though men would object againſt them who come to them in their neceſſities, yet Chriſt and man had never come together; had it not been for neceſſity: neceſſities are not a putting us off, but a drawing us to God, as appears by theſe Invitations. 'Tis folly to neglect God in our trouble. When <hi>Joab</hi> would not come to <hi>Abſolom,</hi> he ſets his Corn on fire, and then he came. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. Though all this be come upon us, yet have we not made our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto thee. Gods aims are accompliſh'd when thou comeſt to him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>I will hide my face, and they will call upon me early.</hi> Let not the affliction ſimply without regard to the precept, and promiſe drive us to God, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>God hath delivered me, and will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me, &amp;c.</hi> Your helping together in your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The qualification of the Perſons and of the prayer, are contained in this; the effectual fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much. Nothing will make us more fervent than afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Sometimes God doth not hear us at the firſt, to make us more fervent: his delays are no denials, God hath ſeveral ways of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that we know not of; we muſt not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude our own model upon God. <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 34.
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:34461:110"/>
                     <hi>I ſought the Lord, and he heard me, and deliver'd me out of all my trouble.</hi> Sometimes God will not give a temporal deliverance, that he may give a ſpiritual; ſometimes he will give both. As St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>God hath delivered me from the mouth of the Lion, and will alſo deliver me from every evil work.</hi> The Martyrs in the 12th of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> would not accept of deliverance from men. There is a Spiritual deliverance in part, as <hi>Pauls</hi> from the Thorn in the Fleſh, or in the whole. God ſometimes delivereth us by death, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was from the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſometimes he delivereth by death, from eternal death.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſeldom doth deliverance fail, when either we are inlarged to pray for it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to wait upon God for it; when thou prepareſt the heart, O Lord, thou inclineſt thy ear: ſo Fathers teach their Children to ask what they have a mind to beſtow.</p>
                  <p>Till we are paſt ſinning, we ſhall not be paſt ſuffering: Becauſe ſuffering follows ſin, as the effect follows the cauſe; and ſuffering is the uſual means which God makes uſe of to reſtrain us from ſin, and to ſet our graces on work, which begin to decay in the Sun-ſhine of proſperity.</p>
                  <p>Though affliction be the fruit of ſin, it may be the mother of vertue; where it is not the mother, it may be, and moſt commonly is the Nurſe, or foſter mother, making us renew our vows and reſolutions, for God brings good out of evil, or otherwiſe he would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unjuſtice, and opreſſion to be done to his children, by the men of the World, of whom he ſaieth, he that toucheth you, toucheth the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34461:111"/>the Apple of mine eye. And if the members ſuffer, the head ſuffers alſo; and our bleſſed Lord and Saviour ſaith, <hi>that he that offendeth the leaſt of the Children of God, 'twere better for that man that a Mill-ſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were thrown into the midſt of the Sea, than that he ſhould offend one of thoſe little ones.</hi> Since Chriſt himſelf accompts their ſufferings his, as theſe and many other Scriptures prove he doth; if in all theit afflictions he is afflicted; if they affect him in the tendereſt place, the apple of his eye, then ſurely he will not permit them to be inflicted in the leaſt degree, or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity more than he ſeeth neceſſary fortheir good.</p>
                  <p>From hence, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſenſe of Gods tender love to his Children might ſpring that undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted confidence, and full aſſurance of faith, which Gods people ſometimes diſcover, as Holy <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him. David</hi> when the people talked of Stoning him, encouraged himſelf in the Lord. <hi>Habakkuk</hi> the Prophet would rejoyce in the Lord, though the Fig-Tree ſhould not bloſſom, neither ſhould fruit be in the vine; though the labour of the Olive ſhould fail, and the Field ſhould yield no encreaſe, though the Flock ſhould be cut off from the fold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The innumerable company of Martyrs in the late Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, and in the 10 perſecutions, when the bodies of the Servants of God were given to be meat for the wild beaſts, and others burned with fire, for the teſtimony of Chriſt, and would not accept deliverance, in hopes of a better reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Their faith was the ſubſtance of the things hoped for, and it ſecured the poſſeſſion of them
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:34461:111"/>which verefied that truth, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. He ſhall not be afraid for any evil tidings, his heart is fixed, and he truſteth in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Faith draweth off the mind from temporal things to eternal, and then from the dark waies of Gods providence to his promiſes in his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and ſo makes a man to commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, as it is 2 of <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have truſted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith puts all into Gods hand, and we are ſafe when we know our goods are in a ſure hand.</p>
                  <p>Submiſſion to God is an act of faith, and love, and an act of obedience, thereby <hi>Job</hi> bleſſed God taking away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> ſubmitted himſelf to God. Saying, <hi>if the Lord hath ſaid to Shimei, curſe David, who ſhall ſay why haſt thou done ſo,</hi> &amp;c. Who can tell whether the Lord will requite good for his railing? readily did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſubmit to all that God pleaſed, when the Prophet told <hi>Eli</hi> of the judgments threatned againſt his Houſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.21. His ſubmiſſive anſwer is, 'Tis the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth good in his ſight; he laid his mouth in the duſt: Guilt makes us fear when God removes the pillar of ſecurity from under our heads by any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the knowledg of God by former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence fortifies faith. This made the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, God would deliver him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. <hi>I truſted in thee, for I ſaid thou art my God.</hi> His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, and Gods Intereſt in him, made him truſt in him, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 13.18. The children of <hi>Judah</hi> prevailed againſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> becauſe they relied upon the Lord. Another help of faith is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34461:112"/>prayer. <hi>Thou ſhalt ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance.</hi> Another is obedience; the old Prophet went out of Gods way, and the Lyon ſlew him.</p>
                  <p>The comfort of the Croſs to the People of God is greater than the joy of worldly men in their abundance of corn, wine, and oyle, the Prophet <hi>Habakkuks</hi> joy in the Lord, in the want of neceſſaries of life, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. Proveth it: for what worldly thing can bear up the mind in Adverſities? <hi>Jobs</hi> hope, and aſſurance, that with thoſe very eyes he ſhould ſee his redeemer made him ſuffer all things patiently, but all <hi>Hamans</hi> greatneſs and happineſs did not avail againſt a diſreſpect.</p>
                  <p>But worldly joy kills the joy in the Holy Ghoſt. They that live in pleaſure, the Holy Apoſtle ſaith, they are dead while they live: when Afflictions have taken off our heart from the love of the world then wee ſeek more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable joy, then is Gods time to give his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants joy in the Holy Ghoſt, the peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and pardon of their ſins. Though for a ſeaſon they are in heavineſs through manifold temptations, they rejoyce in the hope of glory to be revealed. As ſorrowing, they are, though they always rejoyce, as having nothing, yet they poſſeſs all things in value. Their ſorrow is but in ſemblance, their joy reall, and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Their ſeeming ſorrow for a ſeaſon; their rejoycing perpetual. Well then might they take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, and rejoyce that they were counted worthy to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the name of Chriſt and prefer afflictions before the pleaſure of ſin.</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:34461:112"/>
                  <p>I had utterly fainted but that I believe veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the living, <hi>Pſal.</hi> This anchor of hope kept up his fainting ſoul.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Stephen</hi> being ſtoned, then ſaw Heaven opened. So doth faith give to the ſuffering Saints, and Martyrs, a prelibation of the joys of Heaven. As it is reſembled by the firſt fruits of <hi>Canaan</hi> which were brought to the <hi>Iſraelits</hi> in the barren wilderneſs. 'Tis uſual with God to depreſs thoſe which greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions whom he intends to exalt high. And ſo thoſe to whom he reveals himſelf moſt as St. <hi>Paul</hi> experienced.</p>
                  <p>This Apoſtle, though afflicted, had joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and glorious, and received abundance of glorious revelations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>David,</hi> though he walked through the vally of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, would fear no evil, for thou art with me (ſaid he) this apprehenſion of Gods preſence, and almighty ſupportation, will baniſh all fears; but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.3. He was not ſo ſtrong in faith as not to fear, for he ſaith. <hi>Though I am ſometimes afraid, yet put I my truſt in the Lord.</hi> He recovers himſelf out of his fainting fits by the uſe of the means.</p>
                  <p>Twice in one Pſalm we find him fainting, and checking himſelf for it, in theſe expreſſions; <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul? and why ſo diſquieted within me?</hi> Then he raiſeth himſelf up again to hope, and truſt in God by the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience he had had of Gods help, and his intereſt in him, as his God. He is the help of my countenance and my God. Therefore hope thou in God.</p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:34461:113"/>
                  <p>Bleſs God for this, that he hath given us greater things than we are willing to loſe, and that he hath given us Chriſt whom we can not loſe. Let this comfort us; conſider if we are afraid of ſuffering here, how ſhould we be afraid of hell!</p>
                  <p>If we leave our preſent enjoyments for God, it ſhall all be made up in Heaven. God gives us good things that we may have ſomthing of value to leave for Chriſt, <hi>Philip</hi> 1. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced and waxed confident by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> bonds. Suffering adverſity credits the Goſpel, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits thee who ſuffereſt; for Satan, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments are known to ſtrike at the faireſt, and beſt, according to that ſaying, <hi>placet in vulnus maxima cervix.</hi> Sen.</p>
                  <p>If afflictions are cauſe of joy to a believer, as the ſcriptures make out, as that of St. <hi>James,</hi> c. 1. <hi>Count it all joy when you fall into temptations; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the trial of your faith worketh patience,</hi> &amp;c. Then in reſpect of their ſpiritual good they ought to contemn temporal loſſes, as this holy precept teacheth. The example of the practice of this duty was in thoſe bleſſed martyrs, who took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, not accepting deliverance from their perſecuters. The like example we find in St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.14. He glories in his afflictions, ſaying, God forbid that I ſhould glory in any thing ſave the Croſs of Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world. It may be rendered by which the world is crucified to me, &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> Though the contemplation of the Croſs of Chriſt and his bitter ſufferings did throughly motify the Apoſtle; the contemplation of the ſame operation of it to him made him glory. Or the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34461:113"/>afflictions which he ſuffered for Chriſt, which wrought ſuch a mortification in him, made him therefore glory in them. The like is put in practice by other Saints, as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. <hi>By whom alſo we have acceſs by faith</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>And not onely ſo, but we glory in tribulations alſo, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that tribulation worketh patience: And pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience experience, and experience hope.</hi> Beſides theſe graces and many others which are wrought in the ſoul by afflictions. The reward which is given to thoſe who do ſo ſuffer, may well make them ſeem light, and alſo matter of rejoycing, <hi>viz.</hi> That exceeding and eternal weight of glory. They do not only yeild the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs, which alone were ſufficient to make our lives happy, but by theſe is wrought our eternal happineſs alſo, as before is expreſſed: <hi>They work for us an exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> This will prove the truth of Chriſts Doctrine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. My yoak is eaſie, and my burthen is light.</hi> Which may be intended in this ſenſe, that all hardſhip, and pains, which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature can undergo, is but light in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of ſin, or the puniſhment thereof, or elſe that they are but light in reſpect of the reward here, and hereafter or light in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the almighty ſuportation, as it is in the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>v. Hold thou me up, and I ſhall be ſafe.</hi> And that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> I can do all things though Chriſt that ſtrengthens me, for which ſupportation they may rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this promiſe, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee. And that I will be with the in the fire,</hi> &amp;c. Another maine cauſe that makes light the burthen of Chriſt Croſs or yoake, is
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34461:114"/>Love, the Soul ſubmits willingly to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſees in him all cauſes of love, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eellency of Power, majeſty, &amp; glory, are in him. All perfection of beauty in him, every excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent work from him. His kindneſs, love and beneficence to us, above our merit, Hope, or expectation, his paternal relation to us as his creatures, and adopted children in Chriſt, his pittying of us, and pardoning our ſins, and not puniſhing us according to the fear of our guilty conſciences, his peculiar pitty to Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, more than to fallen Angels; the need we have of him, and the benefit we expect from him, on whom for all temporal and eternal good we depend. The ſimilitude alſo of natures may cauſe love; for after the image of God man was made, and is ſo renewed; the neceſſity, and the utility of Gods chaſtiſments, he that had had very good experience of them upon the ſame account with the ſame ſucceſs, confeſſeth in the <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119.67. plainly in theſe words, <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now I have learned the Judgements of thy mouth.</hi> And <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, Pſal.</hi> 119.71. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we are pure in our own eyes. And have better conceits of our own hearts, than of him, who was a man according to Gods own heart, we cannot but ſee with the ſame eyes as he did: That God doth afflict men for their good, to ſanctify them, and teach them in the waies of eternal life, as it is <hi>Pſalm. Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, and teacheſt in the way, that thou mayeſt give him patience in time of Adverſity,</hi> &amp;c. Neither were his afflictions for the ſhort ſeaſon of a day
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34461:114"/>or a year. But conſtant, <hi>Pſal. Even from my youth up, thy terrours have I ſufferd with a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled minds;</hi> and <hi>Pſal. All the day long have I been afflicted, and chaſtened every morning. Pſal.</hi> 119.109. <hi>My ſoul is always in my hand, yet do I not forget thy law.</hi> Wherefore St. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.12. Bids them, think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial which is happened unto you, as though ſome ſtrange thing had happened unto you, which implys, that afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the higheſt degree are common, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar gueſts, to be daily expected. Thoſe were no light ones whereby <hi>Davids</hi> very ſoul was in his hand, and in jeopardy, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.9. I will bring the third part through the fire. It ſhewes the truth of our profeſſion, if we can go on cherfully without outward incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Therefore when God would ſhew the ſincerity of <hi>Job</hi> by removing that objection of Satan. Haſt thou not made a hedge about him? he let looſe the tempter to afflict him with all ſorrows, and to deprive him of all comforts. When God would perfect in us the grace of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, he doth it by affliction as it is, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4. and that where it is makes a perfect Chriſtian, as we ought all to be, as it is <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. Be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philip. Cap.</hi> 1.12. Saith, <hi>The things which have happened unto me have fallen out rather for the furtherance of the Goſpel ſo that my bonds in Chriſt are manifeſt in all the pallace, and in all other places.</hi> So far are afflictions from hindering us in the heavenly race, or from hindering the ſowing of the ſeed of grace in the heart of others, that the patient ſuffering
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34461:115"/>of the Saints of God provokes others to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to ſearch, and inquire what is that principle and Baſis, upon which ſuch reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſtand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. Though they are afflicted, they acknowledge that all the ways of the Lord are mercy, and truth, to ſuch as keep his covenant, and his teſtimonies they, know that of kindneſs, God afflicts them, the very ſame kindneſs is in afflicting them, as was in adopting them, His paternal love; The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of which convinceth them that all things ſhall work for the good of them that love God. This principle every true believer hath; and this made <hi>Moſes</hi> to chuſe afflictions before the pleaſures of ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> The aſſurance of his intereſt in the love of God, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious priviledges of the Saints, by faith in gods promiſes through the merits of the bloody paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Redeemer and the Hope which they have of the <hi>repoſitum</hi> in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour was not only our example of ſuffering wrongfully, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going all griefs and ſorrows, whom being our captaine and head we ought to follow: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our King alſo hath made it a law, for all that will come after him, to deny enjoyments, and to take up the contrary, which our nature ſo much declines, croſſes. The diſcipline which he trained up his diſciples to, and all his follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, was ſuffering. The parable of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſitting down, and firſt to caſt up what his building will coſt him, coucheth the coſt, and paines, grief, and ſelf-denial which a Chriſtian muſt reſolve to undergo for Heaven, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. He told his followers that the world
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:34461:115"/>would hate them, peſecute them, and kill them for his, and the Goſpels ſake.</p>
                  <p>The parable of the Marchant, who having found a field, wherein was contained a treaſure hid, ſold all to purchaſe it, ſheweth what we muſt part with for Heaven. Conſider the ſharneful, painful, curſed death of our Lord. How they deſigned his deriſion in the robes, Crown of thornes, ſalutation, in contempt ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on his face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If our hopes were in this life, we were of all men moſt miſerable. What then can a Servant of God expect here?</p>
                  <p>The comfort of the Scriptures are ſuited to ſuch a condition only, and a great part of the Scripture would be uſeleſs, if there were no ſuch condition. <hi>David</hi> in 119. <hi>Pſal. The ſame is my comfort in my affliction, thy word hath quickned me. Great are the troubles of the Righetous, but the Lord delivereth him out of all Pſal.</hi> 34. <hi>v</hi> 19. and 7. The Angel of the Lord tarrieth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them, and the whole Pſalm is made to ſhew the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of them that truſt in the Lord, and the faithfulneſs of God toward ſuch as truſt in him in time of affliction, and many other of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms are to the ſame effect, that we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures might have Hope. <hi>He is a Father of the Fatherleſs,</hi> and a help to the friendleſs. Our heavenly Father will not endure to hear his children cry long; though heavineſs endureth for a night, joy cometh in the morning, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.12. I know that the Lord will maintain the cauſe of the afflicted, and the right of the poor. The

                  <p>The hatred which the men of the world bear to the people of God, is by the Spirit of God in the Scriptures ſet forth as a principal cauſe of their calamities the <hi>Cap.</hi> of the <hi>op.</hi> of St. <hi>Cain</hi> was of that wicked one and ſlew his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherefore? becauſe his works were evil, and his brothers good: conttariety of works is cauſe of hatred, as well as contrariety of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: men bluſh not before them that are like them, the contrariety makes them bluſh, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.29. <hi>As he that was born after the fleſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted him that was born after the Spirit.</hi> So it is now, he alludes to <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> mocking of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> This is moſt fully ſet forth in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of the ungodly, nor be thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious againſt the evil doers, ver.</hi> 29. <hi>The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeeth the righteous, and ſeeketh occaſion to ſlay him, ver.</hi> 14. <hi>The wicked have drawn the ſword, and bent the bow, to ſlay ſuch as be of an upright converſation. ver.</hi> 12. <hi>The wicked plotteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the righteous, and gnaſheth upon him with his teeth, ver.</hi> 33. <hi>The Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged, ver.</hi> 39.

                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>David</hi> by delighting in Gods word was ſupported.

Satan hath great wrath, becauſe he hath but a ſhort time, therefore the perſecutions under the Goſpel are greater than thoſe were under the law, St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not only ready to ſuffer afflictions for Chriſt, but to dye alſo. Satan was not contented when he had prevailed, in the trial of holy <hi>Job,</hi> to the taking away of his ſubſtance, nor yet when he had prevailed for the depriving of him of his children; but his body alſo muſt be ſmitten.</p>
                  <p>The office of the Comforter would be in vain. If Gods people were never diſmayed. If there were no broken heart to be healed, and bound
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:34461:117"/>up, there needed no ſtrong conſolations of the Holy Spirit, nor no Oil of joy, and gladneſs, if no ſpiritual heavineſs were.

                  <p>The Scriptures, which threaten plagues, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and curſes, cannot be fulfilled, if afflictions ſhould not befal us. Six of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were threatned, unleſs they repented.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34461:123"/>thy word hath laid down, leſt I miſ-ſerve thee as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did, and <hi>Saul,</hi> before he was converted, and inſtead of a reward procure a puniſhment. Teach me to labour firſt to know thy will, then to do it, and not to overdo it, as <hi>Peter,</hi> who would not have his feet only waſhed, but his head alſo. Let knowledg proportion my Zeal to thy will.</p>
               <p>This teacheth me in repenting for my ſins, not to ſorrow above meaſure, and ſo to avoid deſpair, concerning which ſorrowing the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> was warned.</p>
               <p>This teacheth me not to overdo any ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of worſhip.</p>
               <p>It teacheth not to run out of one error into another, like <hi>Sabellius,</hi> who out of Zeal againſt <hi>Arrius</hi> hereſy confounded the Divine, and Humane Natures.</p>
               <p>It teacheth that knowledg is better than Zeal; ſince that only makes Zeal good.</p>
               <p>It teacheth us not to be unſeaſonable with our acts of Zeal and religious duties, but to obſerve fit times; ſo <hi>Abigal</hi> would not rebuke her husband when was drunk. So <hi>Paul</hi> conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the <hi>Jewes</hi> for peace ſake to have <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> Circumciſed.</p>
               <p>There is a ſeaſon to ſtand up againſt ſin, and out of ſeaſon it is not to be done; the works of our calling muſt be done in their time and the works of Religion in their time. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge muſt direct us to the meanes as well as to the end; we muſt not do evil that good may come of it.</p>
               <p>Though we cannot love God too much, and conſequently cannot have too much zeal to God,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:34461:124"/>yet the love and zeal to God may be expreſſed in ſuch actions as may moſt diſobey God, and be diſſervice to him, as this of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pauls;</hi> when out of zeal he perſecuted the Church; and that expreſſed by our Saviour, <hi>Whoever ſhall kill you, ſhall think he doth God good Service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This zeal of the <hi>Jews</hi> is mentioned for their praiſe; the qualification of it (though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge) was their unhappineſs: many pretend zeal, when they ſeek their own intereſt, as <hi>Jehu</hi> did, and thoſe late Sectaries who ruined his Nation.</p>

'Tis not enough that thou art not againſt the ways of God; for the unprofitable Servant was caſt into outward dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the barren fig-tree, whoſe time of Fruit was not come, was curſed.

                  </p>
                  <p>The fruit of Chriſts death, is the Zeal of good works, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar people Zealous of good works.</hi> From</p>
                  <p>Thence it appeares that the note of Gods people is a Zeal of good works, namely the works of mercy, charity, and piety, <hi>They ſhall run and not be weary, walk and not faint.</hi>

                  <p>If we expect any benefit by our ſervice, we muſt not do it negligently, but with Zeal; the more Zeal, the more comfort, and ſatisfaction, and the more will be our reward.</p>
                  <p>Zeal breaks through any reſtraints that would keep us from God. Though <hi>Michael</hi> ſcoffed, yet <hi>David</hi> would not leave off his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing before the Ark.</p>
                  <p>Conſider how violent, and earneſt carnal men are in the ways of ſin, and ſhall they ſerve Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan better than God is ſerved? wicked men are ſo active, and laborious, that they are ſaid to draw iniquity with cart-ropes, they are not
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:34461:126"/>drawn into ſin, but draw ſin; there is no luſt but coſts them ſome ſelf-denial. Their pride muſt feel no cold; the worldly man incroaches not only upon the pleaſures of his life by riſing early, and going to bed late, but alſo defrauds himſelf of neceſſary comforts; they are wiſe in their generation, like the unjuſt ſteward.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Ammon</hi> be ſick for <hi>Tamar,</hi> ſhall not the Spouſe be ſick for Chriſt? ſhall they take more paines to undo themſelves, than the Servants of God to ſave themſelves?</p>
                  <p>Conſider, that you have been violent in the ways of ſin, and will you not do as much for God? <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. <hi>I ſpake after the manner of men; as you have yeilded your ſelves Servants of ſin, ſo now yeild your ſelves Servanss of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto holineſs.</hi> So much as you have ſpent in and upon ſin, 'tis but a modeſt propoſal of the Apoſtle, that you would ſpend ſo much in the ſervice of God. How can your converſion be right, when ſin hath more of your heart than God? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. If we be beſides our ſelves it is for Chriſt; he had been mad againſt Chriſt; 'twas not unmeet if he ſeemed mad for Chriſt, your pace was furious, like <hi>Jehu</hi>'s, for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved luſts, will you be ſlow for God?</p>
                  <p>Conſider, It may be you ſet out late towards Godlineſs, therefore you muſt make the more haſte; Let the time ſpent in your luſts be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. All men ſet out too late; we are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors from the womb; God loved us before we were, from eternity, he loved us before we loved him, or knew how to love him.</p>
                  <p>Conſider what Chriſt hath ſuffered for us, his bloody agonies, and the ſorrows of his Croſs.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:34461:127"/>He is the Captain of our ſalvation, and we muſt follow him. He hath given us heaven as God gave <hi>Canaan,</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but they were to force their way. The power of Satan is broken, but ſome relicts are left for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe.</p>
                  <p>Conſider the enemies of our ſouls are violent. The Devil compaſſeth the earth, therefore we had need to ſtand upon our guard; the enemy watcheth, and do you ſleep? Whileſt men ſlept the enemies ſowed tares among their Corn. Whileſt we are careleſs, the enemy prevails; when we make ſpeed in our flight, the enemy hath no advantage. Whileſt the Diſciples were a ſleep, <hi>Judas,</hi> and his Company, were watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Small meaſure of grace muſt not content the profeſſors of Chriſtianity. <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exeed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> A temporary believer goeth far, but a true believer muſt go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Conſider that all things in Religion are high, and call for more than ordinary from us. There are great obligations upon us. He had no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gift to give us, than his only Son. He could do no more for us, then he did, in his agonies, and ſufferings, and laying down his life, undergoing that intollerable pain that made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?</hi> So that in love God hath gone to the uttermoſt for us, in his power he hath not ſo: every mercy received obligeth us to do more than we have done, the ſupplies of the Spirit of God which come in upon us, and help
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:34461:127"/>more than we have done. The ſupplys of the Spirit of God which come in upon us, and help our infirmities oblige us. The heathen, ſome of them have gone ſo far by the light of nature, that becauſe they could not mortify their luſts, they have put out their eyes, this they did without thoſe helps which we have. Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus a perſon of the God head meriting our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and interceding for us. The Spirit helping us to work out our ſalvation; and the holy precepts of the law of God which is pure, converting the ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. The law of the Lord is exceeding broad. It is another obligation that we have a hope exceeding all that we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. We have a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and eternal weight of glory laid up for us.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe obligations, the dreadful threats might make us earneſt in the works of religion, which if a man do but think of it, cauſeth hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                  <p>Conſider the danger of coldneſs in dutys, if we don't go forward, we go back, like thoſe that row againſt the ſtream.</p>
                  <p>Before we loſe our firſt works we loſe our Love; firſt men grow careleſs, then off goes religion and the ſervice of God. Some that are high in profeſſing are cold in practice. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voake one another to love and good works is a good contention; for ſolemn piety we cannot do too much: In ſin every thing is too much, in grace nothing enough, in particular exerciſes there may be too much in the love of God, there can be no exceſs; many come ſhort, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. They come ſhort of the glory of God, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.11. We are to labour that an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:34461:128"/>entrance may be given us into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Conſider if your heart is dead, and cold, you looſe the comfort of Chriſtian privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and duties, a dead Chriſtian is as none, A change without life is but a morral reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That is true converſion where we are not meerly changed, but quickned by a new principal of life, heathens have been changed from profaneſs to a morral life. I am come ſaith Chriſt that you may have life, and that you may have it more abundantly. All the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt are living ſtones in that building whereof he is the corner ſtone. our Hope is but a fancy if we be dead, and ſlugiſh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. It is called a lively Hope, and our life a living by faith.</p>
                  <p>Conſider the burning Zeal of the antient Servants of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>My ſoul brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth out for the fervent deſire that it hath always to thy commandments. My ſoul is a thirſt for God, Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo longeth my ſoul after thee O God, Pſal.</hi> 16.3. <hi>O God thou art my God early will I ſeek thee, My ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh longeth after thee.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>Do I not hate them that hate thee? and am I not vexed with them that riſe up againſt thee? yea I hate them with a perfect hatred as though they were my eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> So Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was vexed with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean converſation of the wicked; others loved not their lives unto death.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of Heaven ſuffers violence and the violent take it by force, <hi>Jacobs</hi> wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God prevailed.</p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:34461:128"/>
                  <p>It is one of the characters of thoſe that are Redeemed, as it is ſaid in the Epiſt. of St.</p>
                  <p>That he may purchaſe to himſelf a peculiar people Zealous of good works. <hi>Strive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the ſtrait gate.</hi> Many lets we find.</p>
                  <p>Be not weary of well doing. But the further we run in this race, the freſher we are; and like bodies tending to their center, <hi>Velocius in fine quam in principio,</hi> So the Righteous bring forth more fruit in their latter end. When Chriſtians ſhew their fervour of Spirit in the ſervice of God, it is but a ſcandal to religion to ſay they are young converts.</p>
                  <p>The hypocrite deſireth no more but what may be ſufficient to ſerve his turne, but the true Chriſtian deſires to grow in grace, and to abound in the work of the Lord, and is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that his graces are not perfect.</p>
                  <p>By this we imitate Chriſt, for it is ſaid of him, <hi>The Zeal of Gods houſe hath eaten him up.</hi> It was his love to God which cauſed ſuch Zeal; ſo <hi>Davids</hi> love made his eyes guſh out with water to behold ſin.</p>
                  <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour wrought out our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by agonies. And we are commanded to work out our own ſalvation with fear, and trembling. And all the duties of religion are wrought with Agonies, ſtriving, and Zeal. Firſt our faith is to be ſtrived for, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.17. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Then in prayer we are to ſtrive, as it is ſaid, <hi>Striving</hi> togetheir in prayer. And this is that circumſtance that makes it prevail. The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much. The whole <hi>Stadium</hi> of the Chriſtian life is to be run; that
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:34461:129"/>motion is the moſt violent in nature.</p>
                  <p>The whole life of a Chriſtian is a continual fighting of a battle, wherein we put forth all our ſtrength: That gives no time for Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and but very little for neceſſary refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, with food, and ſleep. All our ſervice we do to God, muſt be with a fervent Spirit: If this fire goeth out, our ſervices are dull, flat, and liveleſs.</p>
                  <p>(For where there is life, there is heat) the maxim holds as well in things of Grace, as in things of Nature; therefore if thou wouldeſt not offer a ſacrifice without a heart, ſo oughteſt thou to beware of dulneſs, and coldneſs in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Graces.</p>
                  <p>So if thou wouldeſt not have thy Spiritual Enemies to get any advantage againſt thee, thou muſt be watchful. And that thou maiſt fight againſt them, and ſubdue, and conquer thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, thou muſt put forth all thy ſtrength, and all little enough, when we wreſtle not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Principalities and Powers, and Spiritual Wickedneſſes in High places.</p>
                  <p>And although we do thus fight, and put forth all our power, and watch againſt theſe enemies that they get no advantage, and redeem the time from our worldly buſineſs, diverſions and recreations; Yet we ſhall find our ſelves ſo hardly beſet at all times, and too eaſie to be overcome; unleſs we look to Jeſus Chriſt the Authour and Finiſher of our Faith for his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, through whoſe aſſiſtance we become more than Conquerours; who is both able and willing, to ſuccour his that are tempted.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:34461:129"/>This looking to Chriſt, is to ſet him before us to imitate, and call upon him in time of Temptation with fervent Prayer, as before is mentioned; and to wait upon him for ſtrength: as the eyes of a Maid are unto the hands of her Miſtriſs, ſo our eyes wait upon thee, until thou have mercy upon us. And ſo doing, we ſhall find that he is our ſtrength, and preſent help in trouble, and know how his ſtrength is perfected in weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>He that ſaith, he is not able of himſelf to overcome his Spiritual enemies, therefore will not put forth all his power, and uſe all theſe means, he is content to be led Captive by them.</p>
                  <p>What is it will make thee earneſt and ſervent? Conſider,</p>
                  <p>What it is that lyes at the ſtake, what thou ſtriveſt to ſave, and ſeareſt to loſe? Is it a ſmall and light matter, or is it a thing of more value to thee, than the whole World? Thy Immortal Soul, and the Eternal welfare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? This thou ſtriveſt for.</p>
                  <p>Who doth not ſtrive and ſtruggle to ſave his Life, when in danger? much more then muſt we ſtrive for the ſaving of our Eternal Life. What perils, and labours do Men undergo by Land and Sea, to get a livelihood for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, though they know not how ſhort a time they may live to enjoy it, and frequently loſe their precious lives, in the acquiſition of the ſuſtenance of their Lives: But how few ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo far for the Eternal ſuſtenance of their Soul; or labour ſo hard, or undergo ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſolace or ſave their immortal Soul? How
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:34461:130"/>readily doth the Sea-beaten Merchant toſſed with the Winds and Waves of the Raging Sea, throw haſtily over-board all his precious ſubſtance gotten with great labour and peril of Life, to ſave his ſhort uncertain Life? And wiſely too. But much more wiſe is he that throweth away his periſhing goods, his life, and all; to ſave his Immortal Soul, and his Eternal Life, and well-being. He that is the only wiſe hath told us, that we muſt ſell all to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Heaven; that we muſt cut off our right hand, and pull out our right Eye, if they offend us; that he that will not forſake Father and Mother, Wife and Children, and life it ſelf for him, is not worthy of him; <hi>he that will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it.</hi> Lord God, <hi>we will meditate in thy precepts, and have reſpect unto thy ways; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in thy Statutes; rejoyce in the way of thy Teſtimonies, and take counſel of them. But quicken thou us according to thy Word, Pſ.</hi> 119.14, 15, 16, 25. that we may not faint nor be weary. Be wiſe then, O my Soul, for thy great intereſt; thy main chance, to ſave that with the expence and loſs of thy periſhing momentary concerns, and to beſtow thy pains and induſtry upon this. And let the Children of Life learn this Wiſdom of the Children of the World, for our moſt wiſe Authour of our Salvation hath taught them ſo to do. Do thou fly ſin, as they fly poverty and ſhame; ſeek underſtanding and the knowledge of God, as the World ſeek Silver, and ſearch for her as they ſearch for hid Treaſures, <hi>Then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God, Prov.</hi> 2.4, 5. Let it not ſuffice
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:34461:130"/>thee to ſeek him by night in thy bed, whom thy Soul deſireth. But riſe, and go about the City, enquire for him of the Watchmen, and of all that can probably make any diſcoveries of him; charge them if they find him to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt him to thee; cry after knowledge, lift up thy voice for anderſtauding; as well in thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayers to God, as in thy eager purſuit after it, in ſuch places as it is to be found in. Where thou ſoweſt ſparingly, thou doſt make expectation of reaping ſparingly, or elſe thou may'ſt be aſhamed of thy ſparing. But a far more ſordid, and ſhameful thing it is to be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of thy coſt, and pains; when thou ſoweſt for Glory, Immortality, and Eternal Life; and haſt God and Jeſus Chriſt engaged for thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Thou needeſt not to fear to part with all thou haſt to purchaſe this precious Pearl that is invaluable; the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Crown of Righteouſneſs that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fadeth, ſince there is no hazard of ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; nor any of Anticipation, or preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or for uncertainty; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues on his own behalf, touching his running, fighting, and ſtriving; for all that uſe the ſame means muſt attain it certainly. Be zealous againſt ſin as he was, that vexed his Soul with the unclean converſation of the wicked; but beware of zeal for God againſt God; ſuch as <hi>Pauls</hi> was before his converſion.</p>
                  <p>If every vertuous action affordeth ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him that atchieveth it; then the more ſtrenuous he is in doing it, the more perfect it will be, and the more ſatisfaction it will yield. Lord let this cure the Green-ſickneſs of my Soul.</p>

                  <p>O thou that art the Father of the fatherleſs; the comfort of the comfortleſs; the helper in all needs; the healer of all ſickneſs; the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courer in all wants; the eaſe in all pains; the calm in all ſtorms; the compoſer of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations; the aſſwager of all grief; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer from all dangers; the refuge from all fears: ſtand by me now and ſave me, as thou haſt promiſed; and let me ſee Heaven opened to receive me, and the Angels ready to convey my Soul into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom.</p>
                  <p>And thou bleſſed Jeſus who art mighty to ſave, and haſt finiſhed the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption alone, and ſubdued all our enemies; draw nigh to us in the time of our ſickneſs; when Man's help is vain, when our bodily pains are ſo many, and great in every part of our body, that no part can relieve the other. The mind being altogether unable to fix upon any inward ſolace whereby to ſuſtain, and bear up it ſelf; put forth thy Almighty power to ſuccour me; be my comforter, and conquer
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34461:131"/>death for me, and keep away Satan and all his Temptations.</p>

               <p>If <hi>Croeſus</hi> when taken priſoner by <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and ſentenced to be burned, upon the inſtant when he expected his execution, was exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, by calling to mind the wiſe ſayings of <hi>Solon,</hi> and was willing to die: Shall not I much more rejoyce in death, and be willing to change this unconſtant tranſitory life for the joyes of Heaven, when I call to mind the comfortable words of my Saviour, and the never-fading joy which he hath aſſured me of in the world to come?</p>

                  <hi>Med.</hi> 2. LORD, I have had ſuch a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the ſweet converſation of ſome of thy Saints and Servants departed this life, that I have deſired to be diſſolved, that I might be with them; ſhall I not much more deſire to be diſſolved to be with Chriſt the Lord, whoſe ſweetneſs infinitely ſurpaſſeth the Sons of men.</p>

                  <hi>Med.</hi> 1. Doſt thou paſs the tedious nights of thy ſickneſs in reſtleſneſs, and Dolours; Let it not greatly trouble thee, if thou ſpendeſt thoſe reſtleſs hours in holy Meditation; for thoſe Meditations are a ſweet ſavour to God, and ſervice wherein he delighteth, and God draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh to thee to inſtruct, and teach thee in his ways, and thou draweſt nigh to God, to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34461:132"/>learn his righteous Judgements, and to delight thy Soul in him. And better it is that thou ſhouldeſt want thy reſt, than God to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch ſervices, or thou without thy Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med</hi> 2. As every ſtep of our journy to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is beſet with Temptation, ſo it is with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation of neceſſary conſequence, therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it, and not halcion days of tranquility; the expectation of them will make them more eaſy to be born.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 3. If thy temporal loſſes are the cauſe of inward, and ſpiritual gaines, and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to thee in thy graces, and thou haſt found them ſo formerly, then are they ſtill no cauſe of grief. And do thou O Lord make thy Servant amends for the want of temporal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts with the affluence of Spiritual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 4. If the time of ſickneſs, or Affliction be the time and ſeaſon of the comforts of the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, and not proſpetiry. This is to be choſen and embraced rather than that, <hi>Moſes</hi> made this choice. And thy allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the contrary cannot be compared to his which he diſpiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 5. All Afflictions are either from God or for God; if from God, they are the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a merciful Father for our good, if for God, they are our glory, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.29. <hi>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe in him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi>

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:34461:132"/>which they work for us, nor any hyperbole upon hyperbole; for being borne with love, and child like ſubmiſſion, they endear us more to God, and kindle and inflame his love towards us.</p>
               <p>Conſider them in themſelves, they are but light, and for a moment, for before, <hi>v.</hi> 8. He ſaith, <hi>We are troubled on every ſide perplexed, v.</hi> 9. <hi>Perſecuted, caſt down, yet neither diſtreſſed nor in diſpare, nor forſaken, nor deſtroyed,</hi> which words fully expreſs both their heavineſs, and their lightneſs, and concludes with their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

Nevertheleſs afterwards they yeild the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fruits of righteouſneſs to them that are exerciſed thereby.</p>
               <p>Wouldſt thou have the life of Jeſus manifeſt in thy body? or Jeſus Chriſt to live in thy ſoul? then be content with Afflictions, ſickneſs, and paines continually; or wouldſt thou have an hyperbole on hyperbole of glory, then embrace the Croſs, which worketh it for us, and love God afflicting thee. Wouldſt thou have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Bleſſedneſs hereafter, then be content to be fitted and prepared for the injoyment of it, by a moments miſery; if thou deſireſt theſe ends, uſe thoſe meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 6. The Lord hath ſaid it in his word, that the voice of joy, and thankſgiving is in the dwelling of the righteous; heavineſs may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:34461:133"/>
               <p>He ſaith he creates <hi>Iſrael</hi> a rejoycing. <hi>Truſt thou then in the Lord O my ſoul that thy grief ſhall not always laſt. That the Rod of the wicked ſhall not always reſt on thy back. That he hath not forgotten to be gracious to thee.</hi> Thou haſt found by thine own experience, the truth of theſe gracious dealings of God, and mayſt break out into praiſes of his goodneſs, with the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 25. <hi>O Lord, thou art my God, I will exalt thee, I will praiſe thy name; for thou haſt done wonderful things, thy counſels of old are faithfulneſs and truth, v.</hi> 4. <hi>Thou haſt been a ſtrength to the poor, a ſtrength to the needy in his deſtreſs, a refuge from the ſtorm, a ſhadow from the heat, when the blaſt of the terrible ones is as a ſtorm againſt the wall.</hi> Therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy loving kindneſs of old, now O Lord in the midſt of thy wrath remember mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 7. What Son is there whom his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chaſtneth not? let me ſee the love of a Father in thy chaſtiſements that it is the cup which my Father giveth, that it is thy loving correction, as <hi>David</hi> calls it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> That it is but when need reguires. That it is leſs than I deſerve, that it is that I ſhould not periſh with the World; That thou doſt not afflict nor grieve me willingly; but as unwillingly as a Father his Son in whom he delighteth; 'tis affliction to himſelf. That thou layeſt no more upon me than thou wilt enable me to bear.</p>
               <p>That in all my afflictions, Chriſt ſuffers with me, and he that touches me, touches alſo the Apple of his eye; that when the Lord afflicts me with one hand, he ſupports me with the other. That he corrects me not in wrath.</p>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:34461:133"/>
               <p>That fury is not in him. That his wrath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth but a moment.</p>
               <p>That he will ſave the afflicted people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.27. That it is an undoubted evidence to me of my Adoption, and filiation. And that it ſhall work in my ſoul Patience, Humility meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all other peaceable fruit of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in this life, and an unſpeakable weight of eternal glory hereafter. That as a Father pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth his children, ſo the Lord pitieth me.</p>
               <p>If this I be aſſured of, I ſhall count afflictions matter of joy and rejoycing; for as I deſire the ends, grace and glory, I muſt embrace the means that God uſeth to ſubdue my iniquities, and to teach me obedience, and make me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and account it loving correction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 8. If I would attain the end, I muſt be contented with the trouble and difficulty of the means. Heaven is purchaſed at no leſs a rate than All for it: Whatever is dear unto thee as thy right eye, in this thou muſt deny thy ſelf. Haſt thou tryed and found the difficulty of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, forſaking of the world, and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial? and of thy ſelf thou art not able to attain to them, to conquer thy paſſions, <hi>viz.</hi> thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by an invincible patience; thy revenge, and malice, by doing good for evil, and by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to him who hath ſaid, <hi>Vengeance is mine;</hi> or elſe thy covetous mind of poſſeſſing much, and truſting to the multitude of thy riches; or elſe the luſts of thy fleſh, and youth, pride, or vain-glory, love of pleaſure, and eaſe, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>What thou findeſt thou art not able of thy ſelf to do, thoſe acts of mortification thou haſt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34461:134"/>prayed to God to inable thee to do, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe meſſengers of Satan that buffet thee may depart from thee.</p>
               <p>The Lord by his viſitations and afflictions takes away the ſtrength of thy corruptions, weakens them, and brings them under, and ſo doth that for thee, which thou wert not able to do thy ſelf; thou haſt cauſe to ſay with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thy mouth;</hi> whereas, <hi>before I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted I went aſtray.</hi> Then thou haſt cauſe to rejoyce alſo, as the Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> bids the Brother of a high degree rejoyce when he is brought low.</p>
               <p>It may be thou hadſt need of ſubduing, and keeping under thy body, and inſtead thereof, haſt been rather inclined to pamper it, feeding to the full, and haſt waxed fat, and kicked. The Lord, out of his mercy to thee hath ſent afflictions to purge thee, and heale thee, and to keep under thy body, that thou ſhouldſt ſubdue thy corruption and luſts which are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to break out, do what thou canſt by morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſelf denial, faſting, abſtinance, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which dutys thou haſt been unwilling to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, or at leaſt in ſuch ſort, and meaſure as the Goſpel requireth.</p>
               <p>Thou muſt not only be conntent to uſe and undergo the means, but if thou wilt have grace and glory, thou muſt pray for the means alſo, and deſire it.</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt that viſitations and loving cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections are thoſe means which thy heavenly Father is forced to uſe to reclaim thoſe that go
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:34461:134"/>aſtray, and to improve thoſe that are weak.</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt many of thy graces are weak, and want improvement; thou prayeſt to him to fulfil his promiſes of helping and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his that are weak; if ſo, thou muſt pray for theſe means which he hath appointed, and take up thy Croſs that thou mayeſt be able to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thy Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 9. Thou knoweſt the Diſcipline which God uſeth to his prodigal and undutiful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; If they forſake his waies, he viſits their iniquities with rods, and their ſins with ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, though he doth not utterly take his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs from them. We read not of any of the Saints of God, who went unpuniſhed for their ſins. <hi>Job</hi> cryed out, that God made him poſſeſs the ſins of his youth. <hi>David</hi>'s ſins took ſuch hold upon him that he was not able to look up, he was even conſumed by means of Gods heavy hand; there was no health in his fleſh, nor reſt in his bones, by reaſon of his ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.3. Then he confeſſed his wickedneſs and was ſorry for his ſins, and they were ever in his ſight when the rod was upon him, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Though we alſo believe our ſelves to be the Garden of God, we too muſt be content ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to endure the pruning hook; that our ſuperfluous, and dead branches may be cut off.</p>
               <p>And that the cold North wind, and tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous South wind ariſe, and blow upon us, that our ſpices may flow out, and our Beloved may eat his pleaſant fruits, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.15, 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 10. Examine thy ſelf whether thy heart be not more tender of offending God in the time of thy affliction, than it is in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:34461:135"/>the time of proſperity, and whether thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſelf ſo well diſpoſed for works of piety, and charity in the time of thy proſperity when the world ſmileth on thee, as thou art in the times of thy Viſitation.</p>
               <p>If ſo thou findeſt, and that thou deſireſt to reap thoſe fruits of righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Thou muſt then endure to have the fallow fields of thy heart brake up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meditat.</hi> 11. The many temptations that a Chriſtian encounters in his heavenly race, are not to be numbered, or expreſſed. It is ſo large a field, that I might ſooner loſe my ſelf in it, than make a full ſurvey of it.</p>
               <p>Yet to help a little, that we may know what to expect, and prepare for, we may Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate of the terms which are uſed to deſcribe, and expreſs them, as namely that it is called a warfare, a wreſtling againſt principalities, a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a race, a Pilgrimage, a ſo journing here, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the Croſs, the yoak of Chriſt, bearing a burthen, labour of love, working in the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, a paſſing through the vail of <hi>Baca,</hi> a ſtrait Gate, a narow way. That he that will venter for it muſt ſell all to purchaſe it, alſo they are deſcribed by preparations for war, and for buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>We muſt ſeriouſly weigh, and conſider of theſe difficulties, leaſt we fall upon the like abſurdities as thoſe do who undertake buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or warfare (inſtanced by our Saviour) without due calculations of the charge with their own abilities, and thereby are forced to deſiſt from their work ſhamefully with the loſs of all their charge, and eſtates.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:34461:135"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 12. God is pleaſed to exerciſe the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Servants by various ſorts of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; this affliction in the body by ſickneſs ſeems the greateſt; therefore Satan moved the Lord to ſmite <hi>Job</hi> in his body, after he had afflicted him, in the loſs of his Eſtate and Children; and for all that <hi>Job</hi> retained his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity ſtill; yet the malice of the ſubtle Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſurmiſed; <hi>That if God would put forth his hand, and touch his bone, and his fleſh, he would curſe God to his Face:</hi> thereupon God put him into Satan's hand, to do with him what he would, only ſaving his Life.</p>
               <p>The enemy of Mankind having obtained this liberty, who but a Devil can imagine the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty by him uſed to this poor Man, in every part of his body? certainly all the torments that he could inflict, he did inflict them: he thus being afflicted, and with the noiſomeneſs of his ſores, driven from the ſociety of Men; loathing himſelf, and loathed of all Men; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf down among the Aſhes, and ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the filth from his body with a Potſherd. Satan then inſinuates his Temptation by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, of all that can be imagined moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, his Wife, ſhe thus beſpeaks him: <hi>Doſt thou ſtill retain thine integrity? Curſe God and dye.</hi> But what ſucceſs doth he get? not ſuch as he had when he made uſe of the ſame ſubtilty againſt our firſt Parent, uxorious <hi>Adam,</hi> but the contrary, a repulſe; as courſe and ſevere, as the motion was abſurd, and impious: but yet then after ſeven days ſilence and conſternation of himſelf, and Friends; he curſed the time of his Birth, and Conception; becauſe they gave
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34461:136"/>life to him with ſo much miſery. Health being (in the Judgement of wiſe Men) the choiceſt Jewel that God hath to beſtow on mankind in this Life: the loſs of that, depriving us of all other Earthly bleſſings, and comforts; of Food, Raiment, Wealth, Honour, the Light of the Sun, Wife, Children, Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of the enjoyment of our ſelves, it muſt conſequently be the very greateſt afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This being added to the other two; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the loſs of all his ſubſtance, which might have relieved his diſtreſſed condition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him from the contempt of the baſe people, and that other loſs of his beloved off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, that were formerly his ſolaces, and might now have ſtood by him, and miniſtred to him, when all others had forſaken him, filled the bitter cup of his affliction, yet in all this did not <hi>Job</hi> ſin; he retained his Integrity, and diſproved Satan's Objection; that he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God for the gifts, and benefits he enjoyed. If this ſhould be thy condition; reſolve thou to truſt in him, though he ſhould kill thee, <hi>and wait till thy change come.</hi> And though he hath left thee nothing for which thou mayeſt be obliged; yet bleſs him, and remember, that he that took thy comforts from thee, is the ſame who gave them to thee, and he may do what he will with his own: and as thou art his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thou oweſt ſubmiſſion to him, and to do him all the ſevice thou canſt, and having done all, yet canſt not pretend the leaſt merit.</p>
               <p>Beſides which thou expecteſt eternal recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for all thou doeſt or ſuffereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 13. God had but one Son without ſin,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:34461:136"/>but never a on without ſuffering; ſince that thou canſt not eſcape afflictions, reſolve with thy ſelf to wade through them with as little loſs as thou maieſt, and prefer the temporal loſs, though never ſo great, to avoid the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal loſs bearing in thy body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. Alwaies the dying of the Lord Jeſus, that the life of Jeſus may be manifeſt in thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> 14. If thou wilt have the things of the world, thou muſt take them with their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and burthens; <hi>Tranſit cum onere Terra.</hi> So muſt thou take Heaven alſo with the charge and burthen, through many tribulations thou muſt enter into it. Great muſt be thy troubles, if thou be righteous. If thou forſake Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Houſes, and Land, for Chriſts ſake, the hundred fold reward is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but with trouble.</p>
               <p>Compare then (O my Soul) the immence ſeries of thy own Afflictions of bodily ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and infirmities, alſo thy inward perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mind, with theſe Scriptures which have foretold thee of them; compare them alſo with the Afflictions of other Saints, <hi>David, Job,</hi> the three Children, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> all the Patriarks, Prophets and Apoſtles, and the head of us, and them our bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and be thou contented to ſuffer with him and them; the Servant is not above his Maſter, if they do theſe things in a green Tree what will they do to the dry? &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Having conſidered Gods people in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and melancholly ſtate of ſuffering intend a while (my ſoul) the iſſue, end and ſucceſs, for thus they are contemned in the eye of the world, and their life looked upon as madneſs, for the world knows not that they have a better, and more enduring ſubſtance in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. It knows not that theſe Afflictions work for them a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory</p>
               <p>It knows not that they are ſent to make them partakers of his Holineſs, nor ſeeth the munition of rocks about them; they know not the ſupports that they have in their ſufferings, from Jeſus Chriſt, and the holy Ghoſt, nor the joy proceeding from the exerciſing, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their Faith, Patience, and other Graces; nor the carreſſes, and embraces between Chriſt, and his Spouſe; and although they may read his Love-letters to her, yet they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the hope which ſhe hath by the comfort of the Scriptures. And though they ſee them meet at the Ordinances, they know not how that God makes them joyful in the houſe of prayer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. How they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the pleaſure of Gods houſe.</p>

And becauſe they know not of their joys, and comforts, they like not their waies, nor chuſe their portion; becauſe they are led by their ſenſes, and this life is lived by faith, and not by ſight. And the God of this world hath blinded their eyes, that the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt might not ſhine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour tells his Apoſtles, that they are the light of the world, their ſucceſſours, who preach to us, ſhould ſhew us fully the ſweets, pleaſantneſs, comfort, ſafety and profitableneſs of Religion, and draw us with the cords of love, as Chriſt leads his Spouſe into the banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, into the garden of Nuts, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures her with all manner of ſollaces and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.13. At our gates are all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pleaſent fruits, new, and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my Love; ſo ought Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to inculcate theſe priviledges of Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as Gods word doth, 54. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> at large. And our bleſſed Saviour in the 6. of St. <hi>Matth.</hi> where he ſheweth Gods paternal care over men, to eaſe them of care, that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the matters of their eternal ſalvation. And largly inculcates Gods love to them, and his own love.</p>

               <p>The holy Scripture is very full of proofs to make it out that they have this priviledg, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the word in much affliction and with joy of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. <hi>I am exceeding joyfull in all our afflictions.

Repent and be baptiſed every one of you, for the remiſſion of your ſins, and you ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. <hi>My joy ſhall be in the Lord.</hi> Our bleſſed Saviour teſtifieth the truth of this Aſſertion, <hi>John</hi> 14.16, 17. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34461:138"/>him, becauſe he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you.</hi> Comfort gives joy. <hi>The natural man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spirit.</hi> Beſides the Authorities cited, and many more, which might be cited. It is evidenced by reaſon, that the Saints have ſuch a priviledge. The firſt Reaſon to prove it may be this; That the chief object of their deſire is grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>As the Hart panteth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. From whence I argue, That the deſire accompliſhed is ſweet to the ſoul, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.19. <hi>And their deſire ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, Prov.</hi> 20.24. <hi>The deſire of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall be granted, Pſal.</hi> 145.19. <hi>He will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the deſire of them that fear him.</hi> Now that the object which is chief in their deſires is grace, is proved by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.8. <hi>The deſire of our ſouls is to thy Name.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>Oh how I love thy Law! all the day long is my meditation therein.</hi> Deſire is the act, Love the paſſion from which it proceeds, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>His delight is in the Law of the Lord.</hi> Delight is the enjoyment of that which is loved and deſired. Fruition or enjoyment is joy. So the holy Spouſe accompts it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth for his love is better then wine.</hi> The Holy Goſt doth, and will work theſe deſired graces in their ſouls, and Chriſt will returne reciprocal love, and carreſſes to his Spouſe, and the fulneſs of joy, and will come in and ſup with him that opens to him, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.20. Then the ſoul injoyes her ſelf, when ſhe ſits under his ſhadow with delight <hi>Can.</hi> It is ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.</p>
               <p>Another Argument to prove it may be a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:34461:139"/>
                  <hi>Congruo.</hi> It well became the goodneſs of ſo good, and gracious a Soveraign, when accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Kingly office he put the yoak upon the necks of his Subjects to facilitate the yoak, and ſweeten the lives of his faithful Subjects in the greateſt meaſure, when his goodneſs was ſuch that he laid down his life for them. <hi>John</hi> 10.11. <hi>I am the good ſhepherd, the goodſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd layeth down his life for the Sheep.</hi> He draws them to obedience by love, the grateſt that can be imagined; he promiſeth them rewards, greater than could be conceived. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what the Lord hath prepared for them that ſerve him.</hi> And to facilitate their obedience, gives them the holy Spirit to help their infirmities. And ſends him for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter to relieve, and comfort them when they are afflicted, oppreſſed, or deſtitute of comfort in the world, which he foreſaw they would be, therefore promiſed to ſend it, and his Truth will not ſuffer him to fail; ſo that when their afflictions do abound, their conſolations do much more abound: And when their outward man doth decay, their inward man is renewed day by day; that makes amends for what their outward man ſuffers, with the certainty of their hope begotten and ſtrengthened in them by the Holy Ghoſt; That our vile bodies ſhall one day be made like to his glorious body: That when this earthly Tabernacle is diſſolved, we have a building not made with hands, but eternal in the Heavens; which hopes the Holy Ghoſt doth aſſure to us, and thus gives us joy unſpeakable.</p>
               <p>This priviledge, and many other, Chriſt Jeſus
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:34461:139"/>hath purchaſed for, and given to his people, to oblige and endear them, that they ſhould be a willing people, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.2. <hi>By whom we have acceſs through faith unto this grace wherein we ſtand, and rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God, Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs with confidence to the Throne of grace, Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>The life which I now live, I live by the faith in the Son of God.</hi> He is the Author of our ſalvation, and of all the priviledges we enjoy, becauſe, <hi>to as many as receive him, he gives the priviledge to become the Sons of God;</hi> and that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltes them to all priviledges.</p>
               <p>Another Argument may be fetched <hi>a cauſis;</hi> for as there are pleaſures, and comforts, deſires, and enjoyments natural, cauſing the joy natural; ſo are there found pleaſures, comforts, deſires, and enjoyments ſupernatural, undependent, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, and removed from the natural, and had and injoyed meerly, and only in the privation of thoſe (according to that of the Apoſtle) when we have no comfort in the world, then we have moſt in duty. <hi>As having nothing, yet poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all things;</hi> which joy is fully deſcribed by the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk, c.</hi> 3. <hi>Though the Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree ſhould not bloſſom, neither ſhould fruits be in the Vines; though the labour of the Olive ſhould fail,</hi> &amp;c. yet he would rejoyce in the Lord: And it is promiſed by our bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>My joy ſhall no man take from you.</hi> Which the bleſſed Martyrs in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> found true, when they took joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, and would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept deliverance. Chriſt calls it his joy, partly becauſe he is the Author of it, and doth give
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:34461:140"/>it, according as he promiſed; and partly in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the joys of the world, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from worldly cauſes; and becauſe the world cannot take it away, no more than it can give it; for afflictions and perſecutions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take it away; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>To you it is given to ſuffer;</hi> that is, with joy, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and content, for otherwiſe it were no gift.</p>
               <p>Another argument to prove this priviledg is from the Identity of the principles of the new nature of the Regenerate man, which is the Spirit. Theſe that are ſuch are lead by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is in them; they live after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they are in the Spirit. The Spirit of grace, and of glory reſteth upon them, and being Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, they are delighted with, and ſavour the things of the Spirit only, <hi>&amp; Spiritus ſanctus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilerat ſui participes,</hi> he quickens, and ſtirs up thoſe graces that are in them, and repleniſhes them with the dew of Heaven, without which continual ſupply our graces would fail, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. The two Olive Trees emptied themſelves by golden Pipes into the Lamps. Mortification, and Vivification, and all graces are wrought in us by the Spirit. <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>The water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be a well of water ſpringing up to eternal life. Rom.</hi> 8.22. <hi>If ye by the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Since ye have purified your ſouls in obeying the truth, through the Spirit, being born again,</hi> &amp;c. Both the Will and the Deed are from him, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our infirmities. That which is their meat and drink, which they hunger and thirſt for, and live upon their <hi>Pabulum Animarum,</hi> muſt be ſo qualified, as to refreſh, ſtrengthen, delight, and comfort, and ſo it doth.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:34461:140"/>
               <p>This priviledge will be further made out by the effects thereof, which the Heavenly ſoul doth injoy, therefore it is proper to ſearch out in what particulars the Holy Ghoſt doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and make joyful the believing ſoul; the particulars are contained under three heads; Firſt in their duties performed, the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit doth exhilerate the ſouls of the faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God; this head containeth both active, and paſſive duties, whereby they do exert and put forth their graces, in doing and ſuffering the good will of God. For duties well performed are their injoyments, becauſe they do find the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit inabling them in the performance of them, when they find themſelves inſufficient, and indiſpoſed; and this is matter of joy, and comfort to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have performed by the Spirits aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance the work of prayer, and praiſing God, according to his will, and they are confident that they ſhall enjoy that bleſſed priviledg which Chriſt hath purchaſed for them, by his blood, <hi>viz.</hi> confidence in their acceſs to the Throne of Grace, and aſſurance that they ſhall receive their petitions through the merit of his bloody paſſion and interceſſion. And as every degree of ſin, if but a ſinful, or vain thought, makes a child of God loath himſelf; ſo every degree of holineſs, and every good thought, yields him pleaſure, content and enjoyment. Hereby they are encouraged, and delighted to walk with God in holy Meditation and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. So ſuffering with Chriſt alſo called by <hi>David,</hi> loving correction, is matter of joy. <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we know we ſhall alſo reign
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:34461:141"/>with him;</hi> therefore they are willing to bear his reproach, which they are enabled to do by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit in the time of their tryals; <hi>he revives the ſpirit of the contrite ones, Iſa.</hi> 57.15.</p>
               <p>A ſecond head to which theſe particular acts may be referred, is the ſealing and enſuring the exceeding precious promiſes of the Goſpel to them, whereby they are enabled to live upon a promiſe by faith in him who made it, and is able and willing to perform it to them that truſt in him, through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt. And they find themſelves contented, and willing to live upon the promiſe, and to wait God's leiſure for the time till it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; and for the manner of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof: And theſe workings of the Spirit are all matter of joy and enjoyment to the ſoul to find them ſtirring in their hearts, becauſe they know it to be the Spirit.</p>
               <p>By this they lay hold of the promiſes in the greateſt latitude: <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee. Whoſo dwelleth under the defence of the moſt High, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. No good thing will he withhold from them that live a godly life. They ſhall want no manner of thing that is good. Call upon me in the time of trouble, and I ſhall deliver thee, and thou ſhalt praiſe me, Pſal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>He will not be afraid of evil tydings, Pſal.</hi> 107. <hi>No plague ſhall come nigh his dwelling, Iſa.</hi> 54.17. <hi>No wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon formed againſt thee ſhall proſper,</hi> &amp;c. And that <hi>all things ſhall work for their good;</hi> but chiefly they lay hold on the promiſes of grace.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſolations are alwaies beſtowed upon
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34461:141"/>God's ſuffering Servants, and are moſt proper and ſuitable to that condition. In the multitude of the ſorrows that I had in my heart, thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts refreſht me. The holy Ghoſt working in our hearts ſhew us our Adoption, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our Sins: and that God is at peace with us, and aſſures us of Gods favour, and of Life, and Bleſſedneſs to come; and ſo ſweetens the bitterneſs of the Croſs, by a better hope. Thus God is to us a Sun and a Shield. And in this ſenſe, it is the earneſt of Heaven; as it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Who hath Sealed us, and given us the earneſt of the Spirit in our hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nature of an earneſt is to be but a little part of a greater benefit to come. 'Tis alſo called the <hi>Firſt Fruits;</hi> which ſhews, That the Saints enjoy Heavenly Happineſs here, in ſome degree; for the <hi>firſt Fruits,</hi> and the full Crop are of the ſame nature: and ſo is the Earneſt, and the whole reward. God kiſſeth the Child whom he chaſtiſed, to aſſure him of his love, and his Bowels yearn till he doth it.</p>
               <p>But yet it is not peculiar to Gods afflicted People only to live upon their Earneſt, their Hopes, and the promiſes of Heaven, and preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of Glory. But thoſe alſo who are not in a ſuffering condition do ſo, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did in the Land of Promiſe: and <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Court; and all the Servants of God do mortifie the Deeds of the Body, and are Crucified with Chriſt, that they may live to him, and Chriſt may live in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.22.</p>
               <p>The Third place or Head to which theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Joys, and Comforts may be referred is, In appropriating thoſe many High and Glorious
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34461:142"/>Priviledges of Bleſſedneſs and Happineſs, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. v. 1, 2, 3, 4. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5. Theſe Priviledges can only be rightly underſtood (I conceive) by thoſe who are heirs of them; for if the Carnal Man could underſtand the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of them, he would ſeek the World leſs, and them more; and would like the wiſe Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Goſpel, ſell all to Purchaſe them: for therein is all Bleſſedneſs and ſafety.</p>
               <p>Yet (I conceive) That all that have right to them, do not at all times know their Intereſt in them, becauſe the ſuffering priviledge ſeems to croſs the injoying. For <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14. <hi>Sion</hi> ſaid, The Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me; when the Lord ſaid, <hi>He hath graven her upon the palmes of his hands.</hi> And <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm. <hi>When I made haſte, I ſaid, I am caſt out of the ſight of thine Eyes, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, thou heardſt me.</hi> He did not then injoy theſe Priviledges, becauſe God ſometimes works by contrary means to accompliſh his Promiſe. And not by thoſe means on which we had our expectation: God hath not tied himſelf to means. Hence the Soul raſhly concludes againſt it ſelf, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal. I ſhall one day periſh by the hands of Saul.</hi> So in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.18. The Church concludes againſt her ſelf, <hi>My ſtrength, and my hope are periſhed from the Lord.</hi> But the Holy Spirit doth make out to the Soul its Right and Title to theſe Priviledges. Firſt ſummarily, and comprehenſively when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit certifieth us of our Adoption into Filiation with Chriſt Jeſus throughout his Paſſion, and merit, making us his Brethren, and ſo Children
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34461:142"/>of the ſame heavenly Father: as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 16. The Spirit it ſelf bears Witneſs with our Spirit that we are the Children of God; the ſoul knoweth its title to all other priviledges and bleſſings, as it is ſaid, all are yours, ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods, but it doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thus ſatisfy the ſoul, becauſe ſometimes we grieve the Spirit; they have the effect of their Adoption, but they have not alwaies the comfort of their Adoption, nor the ſenſe of it, therefore, <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. We are commanded to give deligence. <hi>To make our calling and election ſure.</hi> Becauſe he doth not give us the ſenſe, and comfort of it without diligence, and it is not preſerved without diligence; all that are lead by the Spirit of God, are the Children of God, though God might ſometimes hide his face from them. As the unregenerate are all their life time under the Spirit of bondage, and intitled to all curſes, and put out of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and though they are not all their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in terror, as <hi>Cain</hi> was when he ſaid. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever meets me, will ſlay me.</hi> Sometimes they are free from the impreſſions thereof. And Gods children are ſometimes without the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of joy, and the certain apprehenſion of their title to it, or their joy is leſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and is not full for want of diligence in exerciſing their graces, or elſe it may be through weakneſs in grace, or it may be for want of ſeeking it of God by prayer, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereupon, or for ſome unkindneſs done to the Spirit of grace, or may be only becauſe God pleaſeth to give it but at ſpecial ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>But who is there ſo ſtrong but may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34461:143"/>feel corruption ſtirring in his heart? ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an inclination to hearken to the tempter, or ſome ſinful thought injected, or elſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth his corruptions not ſo much conquered as he would have them; and his heart ſo much renewed as he would have it. Theſe cauſe much grief and ſadneſs in the ſoul which deſires to be delivered from them. For the regenerate ſoul is more ſenſible of one grace that it wants, or is weak and defective in, than it is of many graces which it poſſeſſeth. But when it overcomes that temptation which it hath moſt cauſe to fear, then hath it double joy.</p>
               <p>Alſo who is there ſo watchful, careful, and tender of offending the Holy Spirit, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is unkind to it, and cauſeth a breach of love? But as it happeneth in friendſhip, he that falls out with his friend, preſently falls out with himſelf for it, and ſeeks all opportunities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. So the Child of God when he hath grieved the Spirit, doth afflict himſelf for it, and will not reſt till the knot of friendſhip is ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger tied, and the love made greater.</p>
               <p>Now when this Irradiation of the Spirit of God upon our Spirits is thus interrupted, by the hiding of Gods face, or the light of his countenance from us, we are then troubled, as <hi>David</hi> was or as the Spouſe in the <hi>Cant.</hi> When her Beloved had withdrawn himſelf. <hi>And ſhe ſought him, and could not find him, but never left ſeeking him till ſhe did find him.</hi> Being wholly inamoured of him, as ſhe expreſſes by her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the perſume which his fingers touch left up the locks: If he leaves ſo much ſweetneſs behind him where he but toucheth, and goes
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:34461:143"/>away what glorious raviſhments doth he bring into that ſoul wherein he is entertained? here the Spouſe ſuffered as it were an ecclipſe, but not total: when the light of Gods countenance returnes againe, then her light returnes alſo; this is the Spirits bearing witneſs with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and theſe bear witneſs to one another of Gods love to us, and our reciprocal love to God, and conſequently of our Adoption, and title to all priviledges, and bleſſings: this teſtimony alſo inflames our love more, and more to God, and makes theſe high, and holy Impreſſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A child-like ingenuity in the ſervice of God; when a man obeys God, not out of the impulſes of a natural conſcience, but from love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The heart is borne out by the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of another world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every occurrence makes us go to God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Impreſs, It makes us ready, and willing to ſuffer, and undergo joyfully any loſs, or pain, or reproach for God, not accounting our lives, or any thing elſe dear, if we may ſerve God with it; as the bleſſed Martyr ſuffered, &amp; were aſſured that Chriſt had ſuffered for them, &amp; for them purchaſed a Kingdom, it makes us willing to forſake the world, knowing that we have a dwelling place in Heaven; It makes the ſoul hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, heavenly, contented, patient, Holy, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, charitable, pure, and unſpotted of the world. For their great and chief deſire is to know thier duty, and the good will, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Lord, that they may yield their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and cheerful obedience to it, and may be able to do it: when the ſoul is thus diſpoſed, every
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34461:144"/>condition of life is ſweetened to it by the Spirit of Adoption, becauſe it looks upon all things that befal it, as coming from its heavenly Father in love. And deſires, and endeavours that all things may be to him, and to his glory.</p>
               <p>And when the ſoul is thus diſpoſed, and finds it ſelf inabled by the Spirit to do and ſuffer free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, willingly, and readily, all the good will and pleaſure of God, and to ſubmit all things to God, and feels ſuch filial affection to God, ſuch love, ſuch patience, humility, and other work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and impreſſes of the Spirit in it. It hath the Teſtimony of the Spirit upon it, that it is the child of God, becauſe theſe diſpoſitions and impreſſions are wrought in it by the Spirit, and now it can lay title to every priviledge of bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>And the ſenſe and apprehenſion of God's great love to us in the redemption of mankind, and of our own redemption in particular, and the ſenſe of the love of Chriſt Jeſus to us in our redemption, and the knowledge of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt in it. That all his ſufferings had reſpect to me in particular, and my title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to all priviledges is wrought by the holy Spirit, and is teſtified to us by the holy Spirit, and from thence ariſeth our love to God, and to Chriſt by the operation of the Spirit; as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> expreſſeth in the 18th <hi>Pſalm; I will love thee,</hi> &amp;c. This is the higheſt degree of the ſoul's enjoyment, and the higheſt of its deſires, and the fulneſs of its happineſs, and hath all that is deſirable, and there is no <hi>ultra,</hi> no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing deſirable. It followeth, that being

                  </gap>, he humbled himſelf to become man; made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Humbled himſelf to death, even the death of the Croſs;</hi> he denied preferment when they would have made him a King, and when Satan offered him all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and the glory thereof: He denied honour when he would not ſuffer his miracles to be divulged. And this is performed with joy too, becauſe (though it croſſeth our nature) yet it is the very life of our new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it was his meat and drink to do the will of his Father.</p>
               <p>The ſoul that feels this Joy, hath Heaven let into it; therefore it is willing to go to God. This is both oyl and wheels to the ſoul in its heavenly race. <hi>When thou ſhalt inlarge my heart, I will run the waies of thy Commandments,</hi> ſaid holy <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This proves the truth of that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>I have overcome the world;</hi> and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us the impotency of our ſpiritual adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which God delights to ſee his ſervants to overcome, as appears in the tryal of <hi>Job,</hi> and the bleſſed Martyrs, who rejoyced in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
               <p>By this others are incouraged to come in to the Church of God, <hi>Cant. Whither is thy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34461:145"/>gone?</hi> ſaid they to the Spouſe, <hi>that we may ſeek him with thee.</hi> The durableneſs of this joy is expreſſed by our Saviour's ſaying, <hi>My joy no man taketh from you.</hi> All that oppreſſion and perſecution can do, cannot take it from us.</p>
               <p>It is proved, 1. Becauſe Chriſt is both able and willing to give and continue it, maugre the oppoſition of evil men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Reaſon, becauſe the ſupports of this joy are the promiſes, which men cannot impeach, nor impair: Their portion is not within the knowledge of the world, nor within the reach of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Reaſon, the preſerver of this joy is the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe the ſeat of this joy is within, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>in the hidden man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 Reaſon, becauſe the ſeed of this joy is a principle remaining in them, <hi>John. His ſeed remaineth in them,</hi> that is, the new nature, the principle of Holineſs, which is renewed day by day, though their outward man doth decay, and it groweth into a nearer communion with God.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Reaſon, becauſe the enemies that oppoſe this joy are conquered. Chriſt hath overcome them for us; and we by faith overcome them. Senſible troubles may take away ſenſible joys, and external comforts, but not internal; no more than external joyes can take away a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſorrow; our enjoyments may be taken away, and not our joyes. If then they rejoyce in the midſt of their trouble, how will they rejoyce in Heaven, when they have meer joy? When we enjoy the world moſt, we have leaſt of this
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:34461:145"/>joy: the external joy takes away the internal, as the external heat cauſeth internal cold. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware therefore, O my ſoul, that thou ſuffer not thy ſelf to go out to external joy. And beware, my ſoul, that thou doſt not eſteem troubles greater evils than they are, or ought to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed; but as fatherly chaſtiſements ſent to mortifie or corruptions, to take us off the love of the world, and to remove our affections from things below, to things above; then thou wilt not be much terrified, or diſmayed by them, but make a ſanctified uſe of them, to improve thy graces, and walk by faith; and not after the waies of thine own heart, and the ſight of thine eyes. This ſpiritual joy doth arm thee (O my ſoul) againſt the frowns and allurements of adverſe and proſperous fortune. As <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe to ſuffer affliction with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, rather than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin. And our Saviour, <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame:</hi> For this joy ennobleth the ſoul, that it ſcorns to be beholden to viſible objects; as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> ſhewed the nobleneſs of his mind, that he would not be beholding to the King of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to make him rich. So it is ſaid of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat,</hi> that his heart was lifted up in the waies of God.</p>
               <p>This joy and rejoycing in the Lord is enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us as a duty, and it proves our ſincerity. When God is ſweet unto us for himſelf, in the want of outward bleſſings; when we can truſt God, and not ſee him, 'tis a ſign we truſt him in truth, when all the providences of God ſeem to run counter to his promiſes.</p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:34461:146"/>
               <p>That fruit is ſound that can hang in a windy day: Twas a proof of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s love to God, that he could follow him into a ſtrange place, where he had no place to ſet a foot on. This joy, as it begets mortification, and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, ſo theſe begets this joy.</p>
               <p>It is a ſure preſervative againſt Apoſtacy. He that can rejoyce in God when he is in adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will not be removed by adverſity, the joy of the Lord is our ſtrength and ſtability, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The Peace of God which paſſeth all underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhall keep your hearts and minds, through Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Coloſſ. 3.15. <hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts.</hi> It rules in us, if we can rejoyce in a God All-Sufficient: Then the Soul ſaith to all the Devils offers, we have enough already, according to that ſaying of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to our Saviour, <hi>Lord, whether ſhall we go, thou haſt the words of Life?</hi> The reaſon why Satans offers ſeems great to Men, is, becauſe Gods ſeem little.</p>
               <p>This is a holy diſpoſition of the Soul that doth moſt glorifie God. Therefore 'tis ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he gave Glory to God, he did not ſtagger through unbelief. It may well be called a Treaſure, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>we have this Treaſure in Earthen Veſſels;</hi> and our bleſſed Saviour ſpeaketh of the Treaſure in the Heart; for by this we are aſſured that all things are ours, if we are Chriſts. Whereas on the contrary, if we are none of his, we may think that we are rich, and encreaſed in goods, and have need of nothing; &amp; yet we are in truth wretched, miſerable, poor, blind and naked, as it is ſaid of the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Rev.</hi> 3.17.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:34461:146"/>and this treaſure is Chriſt formed in us, of whoſe fulneſs we receive Grace for Grace. And 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. we are ſaid to be partakers of the divine Nature, becauſe it is in us: and our bleſſed Saviour ſaith, that we are grafted into him, and unleſs we abide in him we cannot bear fruit: That is, the fruit of the Spirit, which is by him derived to his Members, as he ſaith, <hi>If I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> The ſame are the fruits of Righteouſneſs, and fruit unto Holineſs; and all have the ſame end, <hi>viz.</hi> ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</p>
               <p>Treaſure where ever it is, is matter of joy: If ſin, and departing from God be an evil, as every Man finds early or late, when he caſts away the bait that beguiled him with anger, then Holineſs muſt needs be good, and yield joy. Though the Children of God are often ſad; yet every act, and working of the Spirit upon the Soul of Man, either is matter of joy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, or mediately, the heart that is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Spirits operation, finds it ſelf bound up, when it hath been broken enough, and hath joy.</p>

               <p>That the Saints have joy from the aſſurance of the pardon of their ſins is expreſs; that the knowledge of our pardon is matter of joy, our Lord and Saviours ſpeech to the ſick Man, proves, <hi>Be of good comfort thy ſins are forgiven thee:</hi> for by this ſpeech our Saviour did intend to give him more comfort, than by reſtoring to him his bodily health. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whoſe Iniquities are forgiven;</hi> the Apoſtles knew
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34461:147"/>they had this bleſſedneſs, as it is expreſſed, In whom we have Redemption through his Blood, even the forgiveneſs of our ſins. <hi>David</hi> was aſſured of his pardon by <hi>Nathan</hi> ſent to him upon that very meſſage: and as we pray daily, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes;</hi> ſo we find that <hi>David</hi> after he knew he was pardoned his ſin, did ſo pray likewiſe for remiſſion, and did alſo believe that they were remitted, and rejoyce in it, as he expreſſeth, <hi>Pſ.

                  <p>As they have priviledges of enjoying, ſo have they of doing. That the righteous perſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms holy and virtuous actions by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, with more freeneſs, facility and delight, than they can be performed by any principle of morality, good nature, or ingenuous education, is plain; for this and that being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, we ſhall eaſily ſee that thoſe that are virtuous by the light of Nature, have had more falls than thoſe that are illuminated by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Word of God.

And he left his Garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</hi> Here encountred, and aſſaulted with ſo ſtrong a temptation of unchaſtity, importunately, and unceſſantly, aſſailing him, backed and aſſiſted with the temptations of Ambition, and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs; and fit opportunity to accompliſh it with ſecreſie; and no reſtraint at all but the

But the freeneſs, readineſs, and facility of the new Nature yieldeth abundance of peace, joy, delight and ſatisfaction to him who is renewed and acted by it; and giveth no offence to the beholders, but full ſatisfaction. And as in this inſtance of Chaſtity we have conſidered it: ſo may we as fully and clearly ſee the ſweet face, and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beauty of this new Nature, and the joy that it yields in the mirrour of patience acted by holy <hi>Job.</hi> And his facility of repelling, and vanquiſhing all the Temptations of Satan, his Wife, and his three Friends.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:34461:149"/>Yet thoſe virtuous perſons found ſuch ſweet delight in virtue by the dimn light of Nature, that they eſteemed the contemplation thereof above all enjoyments, and all content to be in the practice thereof. For they were not Men ſtripped of outward enjoyments, and forced to retire, but eminent. Among the reſt, <hi>Marcus Aurelius, Antoninus Pius</hi> the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>How great then muſt the joy and content be which the Soul enjoyeth when it feeleth the actings of the holy Spirit, carrying it above the ſtrength of Nature in Holineſs and every Grace through the Spirit? whereby it is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Chriſt liveth in it; and enjoyeth him as the Spouſe enjoyeth her Beloved, in which relation the Soul rejoyceth with exceeding joy, as it is deſcribed in the <hi>Canticles.</hi> And this relation is inſeparable from that Relation of being the Sons of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>We are the Sons of God, but it doth not appear what we ſhall be.</hi> The joy of being a Son of God; and to be accepted of God; as it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.35. <hi>In every Nation they that fear God are accepted.</hi> This muſt needs ſatisfie the Soul with joy, peace, and content, and remove all grief and fear.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>This is our rejoycing, that in ſimplicity, and Godly ſincerity, we have our converſation in the World;</hi> it is the Nature of Grace to give inward joy. And it is often preſſed as a duty incumbent upon Believers to rejoyce in the Lord. For ſuch have no cauſe of fear, diſtruſt, or deſpair, be their condition what it will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. Though the Earth be moved, and the Mountains ſhake at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:34461:150"/>though the Waters rage and ſwell, here is repoſe, and reſt, and refuge in the midſt of troubles. And every grace of the holy Spirit doth cauſally bring ſatisfaction, peace and joy in themſelves. And as they excite one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they cauſe happineſs, as well efficiently in <hi>genere cauſarum,</hi> as conditionally by virtue of the pact or Covenant of God made in the Goſpel through the merit of Chriſt Jeſus. And by thoſe Graces we are reſtrained from thoſe evils of ſin, and errours, miſdoings, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, ignorances and follies, as procure to Men ſhame, fear, grief, guilt, and the Wrath of God due to ſin. Though meritoriouſly Chriſt only can deliver us; yet he hath injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe operations of his Spirit as the means to make us Subjects capable of his merit. And though it be ſaid, that while we were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners he died for us, and he juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, yet he doth not juſtifie ungodlineſs; but they are changed by the renewing of the Spirit in the new Birth, in all their faculties; namely, in the Judgement, Will, and affections; whereby they are firſt enlightned to underſtand the principles of Chriſt's Doctrine, and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and do reſolve to practiſe the ſame as it is commanded, reſigning and ſubmitting our wills to his, who hath made us, and redeemed us: all which operations of the Spirit do excite joy in the Soul of the Regenerate, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, it rejoyceth in knowing the truth, and the good will of God, and every particular diſcovery thereof rejoyceth the Soul; but chiefly it rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to find Grace in it ſelf, and a conformity to that will of God, and every degree of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:34461:150"/>Grace in it ſelf and in others rejoyce it; for we find the Apoſtles rejoycing in the Graces which they found in others; but they grieve at ſin ſtirring in themſelves and others. King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> was ſufficiently accompliſhed for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, in the purſuit of finding out the thing that was profitable? What would give reſt? What would afford ſatisfaction? What delight he could find in any thing? What improvement he could make of knowledge? But he did not, nor could attain thereby with all his labour, and induſtry, any thing but to find out the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all things below; and ſo to fill himſelf with vexation, reſtleſneſs, much grief, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſorrow, <hi>Eccleſ. c.</hi> 1. If ſo, then we muſt account him no wiſe Man, who takes any worldly thing for his contentment, ſatisfaction, repoſe, profit, commodity, joy or delight; but he is truly wiſe, who can both diſcern the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vanity, unprofitableneſs, reſtleſneſs, vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, nauſiouſneſs and trouble, with which theſe worldly things fill, vex, and diſquiet, and diſſatisfie vain Man; and ſeeks his joy, comfort, pleaſure, fruition, content, ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and happineſs in things more certain, more laſting, more excellent, more ſpiritual; Thus far alſo Philoſophy went; and hath defined hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be the operation of the Soul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to perfect virtue in a life that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

                  <p>The Immenſe greatneſs of this Joy is not to be expreſſed, Therefore the Apoſtle calls it, Joy unſpeakable, and glorious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. but to prove the immenſity of it, we muſt conſider the cauſe which is Infinite, Eternal, and Almighty; ſuch as the cauſe is, the effect muſt needs be. The aſſurance of God's love and favour in Chriſt Jeſus for our Eternal happineſs hereafter; for our ſecurity, and preſervation here, for our deliverance from all the evills of ſin, and the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:34461:151"/>puniſhments due to it which coming into the Soul, though but by a little glimpſe raviſheth the Soul with infinite joy; when God ſheweth the light of his countenance, and ſmiles, (if I may ſo expreſs it) or looks pleaſant upon the Soul, that thirſteth after him in this Land of barrenneſs; It is ſatisfied. When God owns thee by hearing thy Prayers, and puts forth his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power at thy requeſt for thy ſuccour, whereby thou knoweſt thou haſt an Almighty power for thy aſſiſtance; great is thy joy. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe thou haſt earneſt thereby for the future; that he will never leave thee, nor forſake thee, ſo that no time limits thy joy, nor no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of enioyment, becauſe the matter and cauſe is the infinite power, and infinite goodneſs of God, and the duration of it to Eternity; and this enjoyment doth begin here, when we know our intereſt; that Chriſt is ours, our Attonement, our Paſſeover, ſlain for us as a ſacrifice for our ſins, our Reconciliation and Peace-maker, our Redeemer who hath bought us.</p>
                  <p>Our Mediator, our High Prieſt, our King, our Food, our Bridegroom, our Head, our Life, our Way, our Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Redemption; the <hi>Hymenaeans</hi> of theſe holy Nuptials, and the Song of the Lamb are everlaſting. When God doth aſſure us by his Spirit, that we are reconciled to him through Chriſt, and we are confident of his Almighty power, and goodneſs, ready always to ſuccour us as his Children, his Beloved, his People, his Portion, and his Flock; and that all things are his, and whatever is his we have an intereſt in it, as we have in him, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:34461:152"/>of our Relation to him in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>When we know Chriſt, and God in him, and are known by him, and behold as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, and are changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed after the Image of him that made us, and when the Spirit of Grace and Glory reſts upon us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. When the glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Lord is upon us, when we can ſerve him in the beauty of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; What do we want but to ſee him Face to Face, whom now we ſee in a Glaſs? And to have that in perfection which now is but in part, and to have our vile bodies like his glorious body.</p>

               <p>When our bleſſed Saviour plainly tells us, that the words which he ſpeaks are Spirit; Why ſhould I not underſtand a Spiritual mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe of this myſtery; namely, a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eating of his body, and drinking his Blood? <hi>To as many as received him, he gave Power and Priviledge to become the Sons of God, even to as many as believed in his Name, John</hi> 1.12. But he that eats not his Body, and drinks not his Blood, hath no fellowſhip in him; he that doth eat and drink them hath Eternal Life. The receiving then of him, and believing in his Name, being the qualification that makes us the Sons of God, and his Brethren; and that Text
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:34461:152"/>excluding all from that priviledge that do not eat and drink his Body, and Blood, ſheweth, that by receiving him, and believing in his Name, they eat him, not by diminiſhing him by their Teeth, or digeſting him in their Stomach; but by drawing Life from his Death by Faith, and ſtrengthning and maintaining that new Life which it hath from Chriſt, by believing his Body to be crucified, and his Blood ſhed for them, and by the Bread and Wine is given to them.</p>
               <p>And if we ſhould underſtand this eating, of Attrition, or diminiſhing with the Teeth, and the Drinking; of taking by the Mouth into the Stomach by drops, and digeſting there; then God ſhould ſuffer his Holy One to ſee corruption: For although we ſhould ſuppoſe it did not corrupt in our body ſo long as we live, yet when theſe vile bodies turns to Earth, and rottenneſs, then all that is in them muſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. And the Text that excludes all that eat not his Body and drinks not his Blood, would exclude all Believers from <hi>Adam,</hi> until this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was Inſtituted by our bleſſed Saviour. But if this eating and drinking, be believing; then <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the reſt of the faithful might eat and drink him, as well as they ſaw his day. For all of them eat the ſame Spiritual meat, and drink the ſame Spiritual drink, and receive their Eternal Life and Salvation, from the ſame Jeſus Chriſt. And if we do by this eating find our penitent Souls to revive, and live a new Immortal and Eternal Life, from the belief of his Death and Paſſion for us; his Body Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and his Blood ſpilt for us, to give us Life;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:34461:153"/>then we eat his body, and ſhall live for ever. And thus the faithful people of God by eating the Paſſeover under the Law, did eat Chriſt the true Paſſeover, by eating that which was the Type of him, whom it repreſented, <hi>fide non ore,</hi> at it is ſaid, all eat the ſame Spiritual Bread.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Med.</hi> All the graces are ſo linked together like a golden chaine, that they cannot be without each other. This is a collective word, and containes in it, piety, charity, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and all that the firſt, and ſecond table of the law of God containes, all the duty of man towards God, his neighbour and himſelf; It is the fruit of faith, out of which Root this grace ſprings.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of this grace is laid down in this expreſſion, that without it no man ſhall ſee God, the ſame is implied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. I have ſought thee in holineſs that I might behold thy glory.</p>
               <p>The precepts are many that command us to get it in general, and in the particular branches of it, every commandment and precept in the Scripture are to this end.</p>
               <p>Not any one minute of a Chriſtian life, nor any one action, be it natural action of the body or civil geſture, or behaviour, but it muſt have holineſs imprinted on it; for in the Temple the candleſticks, and the ſnuffers were of pure Gold, and Chriſt came to perfect it, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it, therefore 'tls propheſied of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that under it holines to the Lord ſhall be written upon the Bels of the Horſes which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34461:154"/>was on <hi>Arons</hi> miter. The rights, and ceremonies of purification under the law typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much.</p>
               <p>Although it be ſaid, that faith hath this, and all other graces for its fruits, yet there is a time when a child of God may not percieve in himſelf much, nay ſcarce any life of Holineſs, Humility, Patience, Zeal, Meekneſs, Charity or other graces, as in the Winter the herbs, and Plants ſhew no life at all, uſually they are excited again by ſome extraordinary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, either in afflicting us, or delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us from ſome danger or affliction: or by renewing ſome holy duties, which have been omitted, or elſe by ſome judgment befallen to others, we are warned, and ſtirred up to do our firſt workes, and to quicken the holy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are dying, as by the return of the Sun in the ſpring-time the ſeveral Plants of the earth ſeem to revive, and ſend forth their leaves and fruits again. The cauſes of this deadneſs of faith, holineſs, charity, hope, and other graces, are various, but may be found out, and in ſome perſons a wilful ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and unrepented of is the cauſe, in ſome, ſloth in holy duties, in others worldlyneſs, in others pride, ſome too much relying upon their own ſtrength, and opinion of the grace they have gotten already, not endeavouring after a fuller meaſure, every true Chriſtian feels in himſelf, ſome times theſe ſwoonings away of his graces, and diligently endeavours to get more quickning, by prayer to God for it, and the uſe of Gods word, and ordinances, reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the firſt motives that excited, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:34461:155"/>allured him to the purſuit of thoſe dying gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all ſuch other motives as have ſince confirmed him in the liking of them, and the rewards that he hath obtained from God, for the ſervice he hath done him, and the hope of the eternal recompences. The abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it enforceth his awakned affections reflecting upon thoſe texts which ſo abſolutely preſs the neceſſity of it, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye, but if ye by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit do mortify the deeds of the fleſh ye ſhall live.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 29.

But that we ſhould be conformed to the image of him that made us. <hi>For whom he foreknew he did predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that they ſhould be conformed to the image of his Son.</hi> Therefore our old man is dead, and we are borne again of water and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; whoſo hath the hope of Heaven purifieth himſelf as God is pure; the man after Gods own heart teſtifieth that he had an eye to all

               <p>And that this is the end of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in our redemption, is made out by that which was the Type of the <hi>Iſralites</hi> deliverance out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.42. <hi>And he brought forth his people with joy, and his choſen with gladneſs, and gave them the lands of the heathen, and they took the labours of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in poſſeſſion.</hi> 44.

               <p>The whole deſign, and ſcope of all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is our holineſs, and the reſtoring the image of God in us; all the precepts command this, and the promiſes encourage and invite us to this, and the promiſes of grace are for making us thus; the threats, and curſings drive us to it, the rewards, and puniſhments tend only to ſhew us that God will be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in us, and that every tranſgreſſion ſhall receive a due recompence of reward; all the hiſtory of the Scripture proves it by examples of Gods wrath, and vengeance, upon the wicked, and deliverances wrought wonderfully for them that feared and ſought God with an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hart. Under one of theſe heads might be quoted every text in the Scripture. The Hiſtory of the Creation of the World, which ſheweth forth Gods infinite power and goodneſs working ſo great benefits for the uſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſheweth us our dependance on him, and the duty we owe to him for our being, and well being. The fall of men, and Angels ſhews

All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were ſent of no other errand, but to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:34461:156"/>preſs them to forſake ſin, and turn unto God; all the evil they foretold was conditionally, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would repent, and forſake their ſin.

Our Bleſſed Lord and Saviours Doctrine was the perfection of holineſs, teaching charity to our enemies, to ſell all to buy this Pearl of exceeding value, and in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is angry with his Brother without a cauſe ſhall be in danger of the Judgment. ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever looketh upon a woman to luſt after her hath comitted adultry, v.</hi> 33, 34.

And if God be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by us poor duſt and aſhes every day, we may be contented, if he cauſeth our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Bretheren, ſometimes to provoke us or our Servant <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Nam lingua mali pars peſſima ſervi. Juv.</hi> And it ſerves to humble us, which is neceſſary, both to make us know our ſelves, and alſo to know God. And conſider that detraction alwaies follows worth, as <hi>Scipio, Annibal,</hi> or rather Jeſus Chriſt and his Saints have felt: And as for anger, it reſteth in the boſom
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:34461:158"/>of fools, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.10. Therefore he warneth as the Apoſtle doth to be ſlow to it. It tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to lunacy, as it did <hi>Saul</hi> to the deſtruction of <hi>Nob;</hi> as it did <hi>Caracalla</hi> to the deſtruction of the <hi>Alexandrians:</hi> the madneſs and folly of anger ſufficiently manifeſts it ſelf in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſpeech, habit, geſture, actions and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which is repentance, for that which cannot be undone again; therefore brave and virtuous minds are not ſo much troubled with this paſſion, as the baſe, weak, ſick, and infirm are; for it ſhews greatneſs of mind to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and to diſdain affronts, and to keep it ſelf ſerene, and clear, like the pure Heavens, when free from clouds. And become like to God himſelf, and ſhew the greatneſs of our mind by being merciful to pardon injuries, by clemency, and ſlowneſs to anger; and this Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quality made the Emperour <hi>Titus</hi> ſo beloved and honoured. And if we would have God ſo to us, we ſhould be ſo to our Brethren; but we ſuffer our ſelves to be deceived with ſhadows, as <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3. <hi>We our ſelves were ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, deceived,</hi> &amp;c. So that this may ſuffice to convince that godlineſs is moſt profitable for all things, in this life, and that which is to come.</p>
                  <p>But if thou wilt not be ſatisfied with this, do but examine thine own heart, whether every holy action which thou doſt upon holy prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples doth not yield preſent tranquility, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and ſweeten thy life ever after. And on the contrary, whether every ſinful action doth not diſquiet and diſturb thy mind and conſcience with often flaſhes of horrour, and imbitter thy life ever after, <hi>viz.</hi> if not repented of, with
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:34461:159"/>horrour; and if repented of with grief and diſcontent with thy ſelf for the unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs done to ſo good a God for a thing of nought.</p>
                  <p>Let thy examination be made: firſt in this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> for what injuries received by thee, which thou haſt forgiven, or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, and what joy or ſorrow thou haſt had thereof. And how little thou enjoyeſt thy ſelf, or any thing elſe, which thou poſſeſſeſt when thou art enraged with Anger.</p>
                  <p>Alſo examine thine own reaſon; whether it be not more honourable, and more ſatisfying to thee, to ſhew meekneſs, goodneſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ingenious Education, Courteſie, Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, Love, and Pity in forgiving affronts, and provocations, than to ſhew thy Pride, Malice, Boldneſs, Undaunted Spirit, and Courage in revenging them, beſides the timerity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding thine own Life and Immortal Soul.</p>
                  <p>Then examine thy ſelf alſo in all other acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Holineſs and Unholineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> If thou haſt led thy Life in Temperance, Sobriety and Frugality; whether haſt thou not found the benefit of it throughout thy Life in thy Mind, Body and Eſtate. But if thou haſt otherwiſe lead thy Life; thy Health is impaired, thy Eſtate waſted, thy Soul polluted, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of thy mind dulled and craſed. The like examination thou mayeſt make: if thou haſt kept thy Body in Chaſtity; whether thou haſt not found this to be the beſt means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thy Life, Health and Eſtate, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the ſame benefits to thy Iſſue; beſides many other bleſſings, which this, and every
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:34461:159"/>other Grace hath entailed upon it. But if thou haſt on the contrary been addicted to thy luſts, thou wilt feel the pains of it in thy bones, when age groweth upon thee; and if thou haſt not quite waſted thy Eſtate; yet either thou haſt no lawful Iſſue to inherit it; or if any yet they are unſound, or ſuch as thou haſt no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of, for ſuch perſons who are thus addicted are generally thus puniſhed with one of theſe puniſhments; as we read of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and have ſeen in our own times. Haſt thou fed the hungry, and cloathed the naked with thy fleece, thou knoweſt that thou haſt treaſure in Heaven, if not, thy riches will make themſelves wings.</p>
                  <p>But alas if thou couldſt attain all ſecular ends and intereſts, <hi>Salva Conſcientia,</hi> what are they to him that carrieth on the deſign of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Intereſt, <hi>viz.</hi> For eternal happineſs, how inconſiderable, how impertinent, how vile?</p>
                  <p>But ſince holineſs is the only meanes of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining happineſs; and luſts, and unholineſs are the obſtacles, and impediments that hinder us, and deprive us of it; then be conſtant in the way of holineſs, and take this for thy deſign and main buſineſs, according to that which the Poet <hi>Horrace</hi> directeth thee by the light of Nature. <hi>Lib. Epiſtolar. Primo. Ep.</hi> 6.</p>

                  <p>Twere endleſs labor, and needleſs to cite all authorities, Civil, Moral, and Divine, that might be brought to prove holineſs to be the way and meanes of obtaining happineſs for it is ſo inſeparably joyned to happineſs, that it can hardly be diſtinguiſhed from eternal happineſs, which I conceive is begun in this life in holineſs. I will only mention the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the greateſt of the Sons of men, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who makes repentance and workes meet for repentance to be the way to bring us to Chriſt, who is the way the truth, and the life eternal. In whom we have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life and happineſs. And I conceive all men will confeſs the ſame, though in workes they deny it. All the precepts which our bleſſed Saviour taught, he propounded as the means to attain happineſs. And the doers of them he pronounceth happy actually, in the preſent tenſe; likewiſe all the Commandments which God enjoyned the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were therefore given them to make them happy, and when they kept them, they did make them happy, as they made them holy.</p>
                  <p>Whither tend all Divine and Moral precepts and Philoſophical improvements of the light of nature but to repreſs &amp; mortiify the inordinate paſſion and preturbations of the mind, and the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eyes, and the pride of life; that by this means we might enjoy a ſweet and happy life, in all eaſe, reſt, and peace, joy, quietneſs, holineſs, and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>But imagining that the ſenſual perſons of this age will ſtill oppoſe and ſay that happineſs is mans intereſt, but the holineſs of man is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:34461:160"/>Gods deſign and intereſt.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer firſt; What profit ſhall the Lord have if thou do good?</p>

                  <p>Though it be too great a task for me to undertake; nay for any creature, for he hath found folly in the Angels, and the Heavens are not clean in his ſight, therefore God himſelf teacheth us by his word, and Spirit.

                  <p>The Negative part that ſheweth what is not true holineſs, though by ſome it is ſuppoſed to be holineſs, is the firſt to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour deſcribes the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, and then tells his Diſciples, that <hi>Except their Righteouſneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds theirs, they ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Their Righteouſneſs is condemned as inſufficient, for they juſtified themſelves, and condemned others, and did their works of Piety, and Charity, to be ſeen of men, and were Hypocrites. Therefore Jeſus Chriſt pronounces ſeveral woes againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Again our Saviour reproves the <hi>Jews</hi> ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:34461:161"/>for relying upon the outward priviledges, without the inward Qualifications, ſaying unto them, <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, we have</hi> Abraham <hi>for our Father:</hi> This priviledg, without the life of Holineſs, is like a dead body without a ſoul, which the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> reproves thus, <hi>Truſt not in lying words, ſaying, The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord are theſe, Jeremiah</hi> 7.4. They did freque<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nt the Temple with their Sacrifices, but the Prophet ſaith, <hi>you truſt in lying words.</hi>

                  <p>Do you think to lye, ſteal, and come into my houſe? <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. Chriſt ſhews how that many will come at the day of Judgment with great confidence, ſaying, we have propheſied in thy name, caſt out Devils, and done many wonders. But he will diſown them, how little then will it avail the Papiſts to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Church, and their Pope <hi>Peters</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour?</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour Chriſt doth divide profeſſors into 2 ſorts, <hi>Mathew</hi> 25. Under the terme of wiſe, and fooliſh Virgins, ſome had Oyl in their Lamps, and ſome none, all had Lamps.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes why men reſt in the forme of Godlineſs without the power, are, firſt becauſe they ſee a neceſſity that their actions muſt be changed, but do not ſee a neceſſity that their hearts muſt be changed.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the 3d. of the <hi>Philip.</hi> Refutes the Righteouſneſs which the <hi>Jews</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to their circumciſion and outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and calls them the conciſion, and <hi>verſ.</hi> the 3d. <hi>We are the Circumciſion which worſhip
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:34461:161"/>God in the Spirit, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> This is the reall circumciſion whereby we have the fore-skin of our heart taken away by mortification of all the ſenſes and affections, and is in all the parts of the body, the eyes, the hands, the tongue, the eares, the pallate, &amp;c. This analogical circumciſion remaineth, that of <hi>Moſes</hi> law is taken away; this is Spiritual and may be with blood too, as is ſaid, <hi>You have not yet reſiſted unto blood, ſtriving againſt Sin:</hi> That circumciſion ſignified this mortification, but this is the more difficult. His reaſons of his aſſertion of this are couched in theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> Which rejoyce in Chriſt, and have no confidence in the fleſh. As if he ſhould argue that they that rejoyce, in any thing but Chriſt, and his merits, and alſufficiency are not the heires of Salvation. Nor they who have confidence in any fleſhly thing, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and outward performances, and priviledges. Nor thoſe who put off God with outword bodily worſhip, and do not worſhip him with their hearts, and Spirits, Spiritually, as it is ſaid, they draw nigh with their lips, but their heart is far from me; theſe things they may do that are in the fleſh, but cannot pleaſe God, becauſe they do not juſtice, and love mercy, and walk humbly with God.</p>
                  <p>Holineſs alſo of our own framing is not that which God accompts holineſs, that is to ſay, voluntary Humility, worſhipping of Angels, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Have only a ſhew of Godlineſs.</hi>

                  <p>They that truſt in themſelves, and deſpiſe others as the (Phariſees did) that ſay they have
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:34461:162"/>works of ſupererogation. Nor they that ſay ſtand off, for I am holier then thou, and think well of themſelves, that they are profitable are not Saints. The centurion had a meaner opinion of him ſelf, when he ſaid Lord I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt come under my roof, So had <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, when he ſaid he was not worthy to loofe the lachet of his Saviours ſhooe. And wiſe <hi>Agar</hi> when he ſaid he had not the underſtanding of a man, and was more brutiſh then any, So St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he ſaid he was the meaneſt of the Apoſtles, and not worthy to be calld an Apoſtle. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> profeſſeth the ſame humility, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. ſaying. <hi>Lord I am not high minded, I have no proud looks,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> He ſaith, <hi>Lord I am a worme and no man.</hi> The very ſcorne of men, and the outcaſt of the people this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment is that which becometh holineſs, and is acepted in the ſight of God, for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble, and of <hi>Iſrael</hi> he ſaith when thou wert little in thine owne eyes, then thou wert hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable, and our bleſſed Lord and Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the contention of the Apoſtles for the ſuperiority by inculcating this grace.</p>
                  <p>But to ſeek honour from one another, and to love the praiſe of men, and ſalutation in the Market places, the uppermoſt ſeats in the Synagogues preheminence, precedency, and be called <hi>Rabbi</hi> our bleſſed Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our renders theſe for the charactars of thoſe, who would ſeem to be righteous, and are not.</p>
                  <p>He plucks of the masks and vizards of theſe
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:34461:162"/>Actors of holineſs, and inſtances in their over Actings, to prove that they do but perſonate what they are not, they make broad their Phylacteries. <hi>Tith mint, Annis,</hi> and <hi>Comin,</hi> but neglect the waitysr matters of the law.</p>
                  <p>He ſhews what they are within, in their harts and affections, they waſhed but the out ſide of their cups, their inward parts were foul ſtill, he compares their holineſs to the painted Sepulcres, they flouriſhed it with give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their almes publickly, praying publickly, faſting, and diſviguring their faces, that they may be ſeen to faſt, and thus coming abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, they crave veneration for this maske of holineſs, and they had their rewards which they ſought. Our Saviour tells them what courſe they ſhould take to have a real goodneſs, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.33. <hi>Either make the Tree good, and his fruit good, or make the Tree corrupt, and his ſruit corrupt. v.</hi> 35. <hi>A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth good fruit,</hi> &amp;c.

Therefore <hi>Bafil</hi>'s expreſſion ſeemeth to me to be unſound. <hi>Fugiamus inanem gloriam duleem Spiritualium operum ſpoliatricem, tincam Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> For how can it be called a Spiritutal work, when it is done for vain glory, and not by the Spirit, and for the ſame reaſon, ſuch a work can not be called virtuous, becauſe
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:34461:163"/>the glory and not the virtue is counted ſweet, but nevertheleſs we may take ſuch admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in good part.</p>
                  <p>But it appears that theſe Phariſees princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were not good, becauſe they had ſuch baſe, vain and vile ends whereby they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the weigher matters of the law, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with pairing off the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal enormities, that they might ſeem fair to men from whom they ſought veneration, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for their profeſſions ſake, affecting the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reward of virtue more than virtue it ſelf. But this evil leaven, our ſaviour warned his Diſciples of, and in them as I conceive their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. He ſhews what principles a good man hath, and practiſeth &amp; works by; for though none be good but God abſolutely, yet in ſome degrees they may be good, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> was called a good man. And the good ground was he that received the word in an upright heart; ſo that God judgeth of a man according to his ſtate, not according to ſome particular actions, which may happen to be evil. Such principles, and ſuch works makes a good man that theſe principles do bring forth is proved from the nature of them. They are given to that end that they ſhould bring forth, for God ſeeing the heart weak, and ſtriving to bring forth ſuch fruit, he gives them ſuch graces, by the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Spirit in their hearts, as may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.4. <hi>I will put my Spirit into their hearts.</hi> This is active. Tis called the life, the fountain of living waters, the ſpirit of grace, and the ſpirit of a ſound mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe graces are the motions, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:34461:163"/>of the Spirit, or the Spirit moving. And Secondly, becauſe of the vigour and ſtrength of theſe principles, called the power of God and godlineſs. 3. From their being. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Grace hath in the Heart, is in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo is its well-being; therefore they are ſaid to be ready to dye when they do not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. 4. For the Seat of it; being poſſeſſed of the Heart, which is the chief part over all, and ſo gives Life to all. 5. The heart is ſuppoſed to be the ſeat of the affections, which being made good by ſuch principles, they produce fruit anſwerable.</p>
                  <p>The real goodneſs in the Heart muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted in the action; and the work that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced muſt be good alſo, and muſt proceed from that good principle, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; but theſe good fruits are not proportionable to the goodneſs of his heart, for he is ſorry that they are no better, bluſhing ever at their imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not boaſting of them, nor craving honour for them; the end alſo muſt be good. Theſe qualifications the good works have. They are deſcribed from their cauſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The fruits of the Spirit are love, joy, peace, meekneſs, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 6.22. deſcribed by their end; theſe are fruits unto holineſs. Another difference is, that ſome of thoſe works are ſecret, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to Men, ſuch as are terminated in the action within, as the ſecret riſings of the heart againſt corruptions, as was in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>That which I would, I do not,</hi> and groans for deliverance; ſaying, who ſhall deliver me from this bondage of corruption; alſo ſecret

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:34461:165"/>communion with God in holy duties, reading the word of God, praying, thankſgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, meditating, and the moſt ſevere duties of faſting, humiliation, and repentance, and every meanes of begetting and improving grace he preſerreth before ſatisfying of the ſenſes with pleaſant viands, which whileſt they cheriſh, and delight the body, they deprave the better part, poſſibly, not the intellect, and rational faculty of the ſoul, for that may be improved too by God uſage of the body, ſo it be not to exceſs. But the new nature, the divine Image which is begotten in us by the word of truth, is ſtarved, ſtifled, and grieved: which image, and new nature, though it be in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yet it doth ſo far ſurpaſs the reaſon, as that doth the ſenſes, and is no other thing but the holy Spirit of God, which every rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate perſon hath received in ſome meaſure; for this is that which did regenerate him, which if any man have not, it is certain he is none of his. It is known to be the Spirit of God, becauſe it works not as reaſon doth, by arguments deduced from things viſible to ſenſe, nor ſuch as can be proved by reaſonable conſequence, but it is oftentimes directly oppoſite, and repugnant to reaſon, as in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and ſo in all that undergo any trialls, (and who doth not undergo them?)</p>
               <p>This new ſoul, or new life of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is not ſomented, nouriſhed, or cheriſhed by the elements of the natural, ſenſual, vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, or meerly rational ſoul, but by the word of God, and the dictates of the Spirit, for which it panteth, as the Hart panteth after
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:34461:165"/>the water brooks, and breaketh out for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fervent deſire that it hath alwaies to Gods commandments, which it eſteemeth above Gold, and thirſteth after as the body doth for the neceſſarys of life; and yet the moſt rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and renewed perſon hath the fleſh and coruption alwaies remaining in him; and muſt, and doth pray ſometimes with holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for renovation. <hi>Create in me a clean heart O God, and renew a right Spirit within me. Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi> For we have this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure but in earthen veſſels, we are not aſſured of the continuance of it, therefore we watch againſt our inbred corruptions, and pray for divine ſupportations, knowing our ſlippery ſtanding, our own weakneſs, and the ſtrength of our ſpiritual adverſaries, which aſſails us without intermiſſion. And when we think our ſelves moſt ſtrong, we may fall as the great Apoſtle that denied his Maſter did, becauſe in the beſt of Saints the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and ſometimes leads them captive, and ſuffers not to do the good which they would, but draws them to the evil which they would not, the law of the members warring againſt the law of the mind. Were it otherwiſe, there would be no virtue nor occaſion of reſiſting. The ſenſe of which corruption, and uncleanneſs makes them mourne, bewaile, and abhor themſelves in the words of St. <hi>Paul. O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of ſin, and death? Who can ſay he hath clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf? Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> But yer St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that he that
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:34461:166"/>is born of God ſinneth not, becauſe his ſeed remaineth in him, and the 1 <hi>Epſt. c.</hi> 3. <hi>I have wrote unto you young men, becauſe you have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that wicked one. Love not the world, nor the things of the world.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Whoſoever abideth in him ſinneth not. Whoſever ſinneth hath not ſeen him, nor known him, v.</hi> 7. <hi>Little children let no man deceive you; he that doth righteouſneſs, is righteous, even as he is righteous, v.</hi> 9. <hi>He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin becauſe he is born of God, v.</hi> 8. <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil.</hi> Which Texts are not to be expounded in this ſenſe, that a Saint of God may not be overtaken, or be temped ſo above his ſtrength, as to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come againſt his will, as ſome ſuppoſe it is; for then to what purpoſe doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyne it as a duty? if any one be overtaken with a fault, reſtore ſuch a one in the Spirit of meekneſs, conſidering that thou thy ſelf alſo mayeſt be tempted; unleſs a good man might be overtaken, and the argument too of the duty is poſitive, that thou alſo who art to reſtore him mayeſt be tempted, and overcome; therefore do this duty to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and the promiſe of lifting up thoſe that fall would be needleſs, and thoſe many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of our Saviour &amp; all the Apoſtles to watchfulneſs, and prayer, circumſpection, and carefulneſs, againſt temptations of the world, the fleſh, and the Devil, ſeducers, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, would little become ſo great teachers if there were no need at all of thoſe duties, and no danger in the neglect of them, nor no poſſibility that the regenerate perſon could fall. Then he that ſtandeth needs not to take
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:34461:166"/>ſuch heed leaſt he fall, and St. <hi>John</hi> himſelf alſo ſaith in the firſt Epiſtle, <hi>chap.</hi> 5.17. <hi>All unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is ſin, and there is a ſin not unto death.</hi> And in <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>If any Man ſee his Brother ſin a ſin that is not to death, he ſhall ask, and he ſhall give him life for them that ſin not unto death,</hi> and 1 Epiſt. ch. 1. v. 8. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us: If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive;</hi> and ch. 2. v. 1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But if we were abſolutely free from ſin, and the power of ſinning; what need had we of our Advocate? Therefore it ſeems by the opinion, and conſent of moſt Men, that when he ſaith, <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not,</hi> he meaneth the ſame as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth expreſs, ſaying, <hi>It is not I, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</hi> And again, <hi>ſo with my Spirit I ſerve the Law of God, but with my Fleſh the Law of ſin, and the Law of his Members lead him Captive.</hi> By which it appears, That the inclination of his mind was to ſerve God in all holineſs of Life; and he delighted in that in his inward Man. And if he chanced to do the contrary, it was unwillingly, and he counted it his unhappineſs, and bondage from which he endeavoured to get free. Whereas the unregenerate Man counts ſin his freedom, and every holy obſervance of Gods Commandments, his bondage. And when his Conſcience checks him, and forceth him to any walking with God in religious duties, it is thraldom and bondage to him. For his courſe of Life, and Converſation is to ſerve the Fleſh, and the World; to walk in the ways of his own
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:34461:167"/>Heart, and the ſight of his eyes, and is ſorry that there is any Commandment to reſtrain him, and deſires not to know it (at leaſt in the ſtrictneſs of it.) Again, if a regenerate perſon chance to be overcome by his corruption, and ſtrength of Temptation, he immediately not only loaths the ſin, but himſelf alſo, that he is no better; and would rather undergo all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, than fall into the ſame again. And would foregoe all the enjoyments that he hath, or hopes for in this World, if he could but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, what he hath miſdone. The unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are not ſo: and as <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribes the Harlot, <hi>ſhe wipeth her mouth, and ſaith, I have not ſinned:</hi> ſo do others in the ſtate of Nature, unleſs their ſins be very groſs, ſay, they have not ſinned; or if they confeſs their ſins to God, and pray for pardon, they think it is enough to embolden them to ſin afreſh. And as the Regenerate walk with God, and premeditate, and ſtudy, (not how they may commit a ſin ſecretly, and undiſcovered, ſo as to avoid the ſhame and puniſhment) but how they may walk cloſely with God, and avoid every Temptation and Snare of Satan: ſo the unregenerate ſtudy and contrive to ſin with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And that place of St. <hi>John,</hi> that ſaith, <hi>ye have overcome the evil one,</hi> may be upon this ground, that they have overcome the evil one many times, and perſiſt in the conqueſt of their corruption every day: though peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſome time the Devil may prevail to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, as it is ſaid, <hi>he ſhall bruiſe thy heel:</hi> And though God never leaves Man to be overcome, when he endeavours his utmoſt,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:34461:167"/>yet God may let him be overcome, as <hi>Peter</hi> was to humble him in the ſight of his own weakeneſs when he is confident of his ſtrength that he may depend, and rely more upon God, and ſeek to him more, and not rely upon his own ſtrength, but aſcribe all to God, and his grace. And though St. <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth ſo much imperfection, and St. <hi>John</hi> ſo much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, both of them will agree in this, that we are made perfect in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> further deſcribeth the perfections of the regenerate, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Whoſoever is borne of God overcometh the world.</hi> And ſheweth how, in the following words, and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our ſaith. He tells us the particulars which he means, namely, The luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eyes, and the pride of life, which all are overcome, for <hi>ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 7. He ſaith, <hi>That he that doth righteouſnes is righteous.</hi> And 10. <hi>Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God.</hi> And 1 <hi>Ep. c.</hi> 5.18. <hi>We know that whoſoever is borne of God ſinneth not, for he that is begotten of God keepeth himſelf, and the wicked one touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him not.</hi> Which touching certainly hath reference to the words before, of ſinning a ſin not unto death, and thoſe words, ſinneth not, have the ſame reference, <hi>viz.</hi> He ſinneth not. <hi>de induſtria Pleno Animo.</hi> Elſe no man will be found that it can be ſaid of him that he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not. <hi>Noah</hi> whom God mentioned for one of the three perſons moſt acceptable to God, of whom it is teſtified in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that he only was found righteous, yet he was overtaken by the ſin of drunkenneſs,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:34461:168"/>this ſenſe is made clear to be the meaning of the place by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. where in <hi>v.</hi> 166. He ſaith, <hi>Lord I have hoped for thy ſalvation, and done after thy Commandments.</hi> 167. <hi>My ſoul hath kept thy teſtimonies, and I love them exceedingly, v.</hi> 168. <hi>I have kept thy precepts, and thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, for all my waies are before thee.</hi> He had an eye to all Gods Commandments. But it followeth in the ſame <hi>Pſal. ver.</hi> the laſt, <hi>I have gone aſtray like a ſheep that is loſt, ſeek thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. David</hi> did not alwaies keep Gods teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, if he had, he had not gone aſtray, nor needed ſeeking, neither yet went he ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray as to forget the way to return, as the words imply which follow, <hi>Seek thy Servant, for I do not forget thy Commandments.</hi> And <hi>Pſal. I have not forſaken thee, as the wicked doth.</hi> For when he did fall, as in the numbring of the people, and likewiſe in the matter of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> his heart ſoone ſmote him, and he humbled himſelf with weeping, faſting, and prayer, and ſacrificing, and renewing his vows of better obedience, confeſſing his ſins with grief, and ſhame, patiently enduring ſuch chaſtiſements as God layed upon him. Neither ſin nor the puniſhments which he ſuffered for his ſin could prevail to extinguiſh his love to God and holineſs, becauſe he was regenerate, and borne againe and his ſeed remained in him; therefore he ſtill retaines good thoughts of God, and his waies, as he expreſleth in the Pſalmes, chiefly the 119. <hi>My ſoul breaketh out for the deſire it hath alwaies to thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> His eyes prevented the morning watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that he might be occupied in Gods word,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:34461:168"/>which he ſaith, he eſteemed above Gold, and had choſen for his heritage, becauſe they were the very joy of his heart, and this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him forth to praiſe, and extol the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Gods word and Commandments, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thy teſtimonies are wonderful, therefore doth my ſoul love them.</hi> And again, they are tried to the utmoſt. They are exceeding righteous, and true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have more underſtanding than my teachers, for thy Commandments are my ſtudy. Except my delight had been in thy Commandments it had not failed, but I had periſhed in my trouble. Thy word giveth light, and underſtanding to the ſimple.</hi> And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. <hi>The law of the Lord is an undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led law converting the ſoul, the teſtimony of the Lord is ſure and giveth wiſdom to the ſimple. The ſtatutes of the Lord are right, and rejoyce the heart. The Commandment of the Lord is pure and giveth light unto the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever. The Judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether, more to be deſired are they than Gold, yea than much fine Gold, ſweeter alſo than the hony and the hony comb. Moreover by them is thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant taught, and in keeping of them there is great reward.</hi> His hatred alſo was changed to hate that which God hated (as he ſaith) <hi>I hate them that hate thee.</hi> And <hi>I hate all falſe waies, but thy Law do I love.</hi> This holy love makes the yoak of Chriſt not only eaſy, but delightful. As <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. <hi>Her waies are waies of peace, and all her paths are pleaſantneſs.</hi> And <hi>thoſe that walk in her paths ſhall not ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for all her paths are right paths.</hi> And they
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:34461:169"/>know that theſe paths are right, and lead to happineſs, peace, reſt, and life, for that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience they have had already, and taſte of thoſe heavenly gifts and power of the world to come, they retain with good liking, and they thirſt for a further enjoyment of them; albeit God ſuffers them ſometimes to fall, that they may know their own weakneſs, may learn hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, be more diligent in prayer and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, live more by faith, and depend upon God, and aſcribe all to Chriſt Jeſus, who is all, and in all; and that they may go out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, when he deſired to be found in him, not having his own Righteouſneſs, for he ſaw the imperfection and inſufficiency of his own Righteouſneſs, and therefore ſought it in him; <hi>Who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption;</hi> for he is the only Righteouſneſs on which we can truſt for our Juſtification, <hi>Jehova Juſtitia noſtra, &amp; omnis Juſtitia noſtra pannis menſtruata.</hi> God that hath found folly in the Angels, ſees ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in our beſt duties I and that <hi>all have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> and are righteous by God's mercy only, not imputing their ſin. As <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered. V.</hi> 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth no ſin, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile:</hi> That all fleſh may be ſilent, and all mouths may be ſtopped before him. But God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks the frailties of thoſe that are ſincere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, in whom there is no guile, hypocriſie or diſſimulation in their love to him: who eſchew their own ſin, which their nature is
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:34461:169"/>moſt inclined to; As <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. ſaith, <hi>I was alſo uncorrupt before him, and eſchewed my own wickedneſs.</hi> They allow themſelves in no ſin, nor in any degree of ſinfulneſs. As <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> would be excuſed in bowing to <hi>Ammon</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon.</hi> So many ſeeming righteous, are holden captive by ſome one luſt, which they like not to have ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. But thoſe whom Chriſt gave himſelf for, he hath redeemed from all iniquity, and purified them unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works. Albeit their beſt works are imperfect, for who can bring a cleane thing out of an unclean thing? not any, yet are they who are Chriſts redeemed ones, zealous of all good works, and (with <hi>David</hi>) they can ſay they have an eye unto all Gods Commandments, and have put off the old man and all his works.</p>
               <p>And it is from a principle of love, and deſire from the ſenſe of Gods love to them, and the deſire of obeying him, who hath ſo obliged them, together with a love and liking they have to the waies of God, by reaſon of the new nature, begotten by God in them, in the act of regeneration. This Divine love breathed, lived, and moved in <hi>David</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his mercies towards me? And Oh how I love thy law.</hi> And in the ſame manner the Servants of God find it to move, and it is the fulfilling of the law in Gods account and acceptance.</p>
               <p>As on the contrary diſobedience proceeds from unthankfulneſs to God for his mercies, and forgetfulneſs of them, whereby the love of God is extinct, as in the rebellious <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:34461:170"/>They remembred not his marvelous works that he had done, but were diſobedient at the Sea, even the Red Sea, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.13. Within a while they forgat his works, and would not abide his counſel, but luſt came upon them in the Wilderneſs. That it is the way of Gods dealing with his people thus to oblige them to his ſervice by beneficence, and bounty, and wonderful deliverances wherein his hand, and almighty power onely could help us, appears by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Which recites the wonders which God wrought for the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he delivered them from that thraldom, and afterwards brought them to the promiſed land that flowed with Milk and Hony. The end of all which, is expreſſed in the laſt <hi>ver.</hi> That they might keep his ſtatutes, and obſerve his laws. When God beſtowes ſuch great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon us, as aſtoniſh our underſtanding, as he did to them, they were like men that dream when they were deliverd from Captivity, when he delivereth us miraculouſly, juſt then when we are at the very brink of deſtruction, when the knife is at our throats, or like brands pulled out of the fire, ſo are we reſcued, and ſometimes we are ſo reſcued from the precipice of Hell before we are conſumed, it is no cauſe that may induce us to think that we are better than others, or that it is for our own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake. God forwarneth the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from ſuch miſconceptions, and that caution ſeemeth to imply that we are prone of our ſelves to ſuch deluſions, God commands them when they bring their offering to ſay, <hi>A Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ready to periſh was my Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:34461:170"/>
               <p>But the cauſe that moved God was from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe of his love, and favour which he had to them; his goodneſs only was the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, and the final cauſe his own glory; and ſo it is of all our deliverances, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered ſhould ſerve him in holineſs, and righteouſneſs before him, all the daies of our lives. Sutable thereto is the practice of Gods Servants, for they aſcribe them not to their own merit, but reflect upon their own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, that they may aſcribe the more to Gods free goodneſs, and mercy, ſaying with <hi>David, What am I? and what is my Fathers houſe that thou ſhouldſt do ſuch great things for me? Pſal.</hi> 116.9. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>Lord what is man that thou art mindful of him? or the Son of man that thou viſiteſt him.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Gods mercy to him, who he ſaith, <hi>Was the leaſt of the Apoſtles, and not worthy to be called an Apoſtle.</hi> Which humility of mind, and ſenſe of our own unworthineſs, kindles the flame of our holy love to God for all his goodneſs, and excites our Zeal to do all we can for God. And not only the mercies received, are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to inflame our affections to love God our great benefactor, but the mercies alſo which we hope for, and expect hereafter, as in 2 of <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.19. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks to God, <hi>Who am I O Lord, and what is my houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto! And this was yet a ſmall thing in thy ſight O Lord God, but thou haſt ſpoken alſo of thy Servants houſe for a great while to come, and is this the manner of men O Lord God!</hi> Though men, the more they have done, the leſs we can expect from them, yet
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:34461:171"/>with God every mercy is an earneſt of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, therefore he argued well that ſaid, <hi>The Lord delivered me from the Lyon, and Bear, and will deliver me from this uncircumciſed Philiſtine.</hi> So did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Lord hath delivered me, and will deliver me.</hi> And this aſſurance, and hope alone in the want of all outward comforts by the ſtrength of faith was able to ſupport holy <hi>Job,</hi> for therefore he was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer over all theſe fiery darts of Satan, and was able to do, and ſuffer the good will, and pleaſure of God, becauſe he believed that his redeemer lived, and that he ſhould ſee him at the laſt day. A further improvement, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſoul makes of mercies to engage its love and affections to God in the conſideration of the overplus which God in his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and liberality beſtowes upon us above our deſires, and requeſts: as when <hi>Solomon</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wiſdom, God beſtowed upon him riches, and honour; and when <hi>David</hi> asked life, God gave him a long life, even for ever, and ever. So <hi>Abraham</hi> asked a child, and God gave him ſeed as the ſand of the Sea. And we know of our own experience, how God hath exceeded our requeſts, for many temporal bleſſings, which for the preſent when we had received them ſeemed great to us, and to a thankful heart they will alwaies ſeem ſo, and have the ſame operation to affect the heart with burning love to ſo great a benefactor. But much more that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of eternal happineſs, which the Saints believe they ſhall receive. <hi>For eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what the Lord hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:34461:171"/>for them that love him.</hi> And as a Virgin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved puts not an eſtimate upon the gifts of her Lover according to their meer value, but according to the reſpect which ſhe hath to his love, whereof they are pledges, ſo the heavenly ſoul alſo looks more upon the love and favour of God ſhewed in his mercies, than upon the benefit it receives by them, as <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth in the Pſalmes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. ſaying, <hi>Thy loving kindneſs is better than life it ſelf.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Spouſe in the <hi>Cant. Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth, for his love is better then Wine.</hi> Which holy love, the ſoul delights in, and by it all duties in religion and works of piety, charity, and mortification are made eaſy, delightful, and deſirable, and not burthenſome. And ſo love may be ſaid to be the fulfilling of the law, becauſe God accepts the will of them that are carried by this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. And they likewiſe accept of all that comes from God as from his love, whether it be affliction, or proſperity, becauſe they believe that God will bring good out of evils, and cauſe all things to work together for their good, and will ſhew his love and faithfulneſs in delivering them, and will give them their hearts deſire, if they delight themſelves in the Lord. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4.) And injoy themſelves in ſerving him, call the Sabbath a delight, and as the Spouſe in the <hi>Cant. ch.</hi> 1. <hi>Sit under his ſhadow with delight.</hi> If they truſt in him, hope in him, rely upon him, ſtay themſelves upon him. All which duties, and all others they can do in ſome degree through Chriſt that ſtrengthens them, from whom they have all
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:34461:172"/>their ſufficiency, whoſe Grace is ſufficient for them, though of themſelves they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, not think a good thought, for his ſtrength is perfected in their weakneſs, and his Spirit helpeth their infirmity; for inſtance, in the duty of Prayer; they will approach the Throne of Grace, to pray, and praiſe God, though they feel in themſelves dulneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition; becauſe they have found aſſiſtance in former duties, from Gods Spirit enabling them, when they were as much indiſpoſed as at preſent, therefore they do hope for, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the like again; and therefore they go on aſſured (as <hi>Abraham</hi> was) that God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himſelf a Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>A parallel inſtance is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, when the <hi>Stimulus in carne,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or irritation in the Fleſh buffeted him: Firſt, he is ſenſible of his own weakneſs and uſeth violence upon himſelf, and keeps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his body; yet he did not truſt in theſe means, becauſe he knew their inſufficiency. Therefore he ſeeks help and aſſiſtance from him that is All-ſufficient, and beſought God againſt it; that it might depart from him, which God was not pleaſed to grant, as appeareth, becauſe the Holy Man was ſubject to be tranſported with Pride, becauſe of the extraordinary pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and abundance of Revelations, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him. Yet he obtained that which was better for him, Grace ſufficient, for when he was weak in himſelf, he was then ſtrong in Grace. And that <hi>Stimulus</hi> ſuffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to prick the bladder of his Pride, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:34461:172"/>probably for the ſame reaſons God may ſuffer many of us to undergo the like buffetings from our corruptions, and yet ſupport, and ſuſtain us in the encounter, that we fall not. If we be careful as the Apoſtle was, to make uſe of the ſame means, <hi>viz.</hi> ſubduing our body, and prayer. For we have all the ſame promiſes, as theſe men had, and the ſame means to obtain Grace and Life Eternal: To know God and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent; and he that hath but the hope of Eternal Life purifyeth himſelf, even as he is pure, and this purifying is by denying our ſelves, taking up our Croſs, and following Chriſt, which is the Act of Faith, and the Life of Faith. And by Faith too, it is ſcarcely attainable, with great difficulty, as our Saviour himſelf tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, for narrow is the way;</hi> And <hi>the righteous ſhall ſcarcely be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, &amp;c.</hi> And thoſe who have both Faith whereby they are able to overcome the World by Gods aſſiſtance, and the Spirit too to aſſiſt them; yet theſe find that though the Spirit is willing, the fleſh is weak. That is, though thou ſubdue it never ſo much; yet, though it be ſubdued, that it dare not much oppoſe, yet it will ſtill be unable to keep Pace with the motions of the Spirit. Yet I fear too, that it will never be ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, but I ſhall be forced to bewail my ſelf often with the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> 8. <hi>The Law is Spiritual, but I am car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> but as he diſowned himſelf in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſaying, <hi>'tis no more I, but ſin that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:34461:173"/>in me.</hi> So may every child of God whoſe will is as his was; and uſeth the means that he did. And ſo will God own them for that which is his Image in them. By this the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſheweth the enemy with whom he had fought the good fight, and having fought it, he aſſures himſelf, that God will give him the Crown. And having ſowed the ſeed, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to reap the ſame he ſowed; for he ſowed to the Spirit, and of the Spirit hoped to reap life everlaſting, which the Righteous Judge will give to all that love his appearance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. <hi>Let him that is holy be holy ſtill.</hi>

                  <p>Alſo it is appointed as a neceſſary means to attain this end, by our Saviour himſelf, that we learn of him, and we are taught ſo to do by the holy Apoſtles. <hi>That we ſhould walke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he walked,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6.

                  <p>The laſt means, but not the leaſt, is Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; the ſame which was the firſt, not a ſlight confeſſion of our ſins only, with ſorrow for a day, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.5. To hang down our heads like a bulruſh for a day. Wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> did more than ſo. Thy ſtony heart will endure more malliating than one daies contrition, and not be broke. But ſuch ſorrow as may work a change, as that of the <hi>Ninevites, Jonah</hi> 3.8, 10. They turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their evil way, cloathed themſelves in ſackcloth, and cryed mightily to God. And ſince notwithſtanding our repentance, our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and our ſpiritual enemies do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prevail againſt us, we muſt as oft as we fall, riſe again by repentance, and mourn over the ſinfulneſs of our nature, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>In ſin hath my Mother conceived me:</hi> And <hi>Paul, When I would do good, evil is preſent.

For I conceive the method of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the penitent is, that he believes that his ſins were ſharers in procuring thoſe bitter ſufferings to his Saviour, which he cannot think
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:34461:175"/>of without grief, and breaking off thoſe ſins; and that grief leads him to believe that Chriſt in his ſufferings had reſpect to his ſins; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords comfort.</p>

               <p>When I have fallen into any ſin, I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately perceive my loſs of my innocency, as our firſt parents did, and the injury done to God. And then I loath my ſelf, and would give all I have to be reſtored to my guiltleſs ſtate again, if I could but undo that which I have done, and I reſolve to ſpend all my life in weeping, faſting, and prayer, if ſo be the Lord will have mercy upon me, and pardon my ſin, and not deſtroy me, then I ſee that nothing I can do or ſuffer can make attonement to God for my ſin: But my ſtedfaſt reſolution is that I will never ſin more. O Lord give me the ſame minde now and ever, that my ſins may be ever in my ſight to bewaile the loſs of my innocency and the injury done to thee, to loath my ſinful ſelf, to endeavour night and day, to undo thoſe ſinful acts by teares of repentance, mourning, humble, confeſſion, prayers, faſting, charity, and ſevere watchfulneſs againſt my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions the duties of mortification, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial. And to renew my vows, and reſolutions never to ſin more. And for the remainder of my days to abſtain from the leaſt degree of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſin, and not to go as far as I think I may lawfully do in the ſatisfying of my ſenſes, and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:34461:175"/>paſſions, leaſt I be drawn in one degree too far. That the Lord may behold my grievous ſorrow and repentance, as he did <hi>Peters</hi> and <hi>Davids,</hi> and may have mercy upon me, and pardon me, and not deſtroy me, and take his holy Spirit utterly from me as he did from <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Lord, (Though my ſins are as ſcarlet) do thou waſh me throughly with the blood of my Saviour which onely can purge my ſins, and is the only propitiation to attone thy wrath, and to reconcile me to thee, and reſtore me to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting righteouſneſs better than mine own which I loſt, and makes me white as Snow, and being ſo waſhed, and cleanſed, I ſhall have communion again with my God, and peace of conſcience, and abhor thoſe ſins that cauſed my Saviours ſufferings.</p>
               <p>Lord, thy mercy would have no object, if there were no miſery. All that are deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi> have been prodigal Sons, as he was; and by their prodigalities have forſaken thee daies without number, and have ſought out to themſelves many inventions. I find in my own heart, that I would ſtay from thee, and never return to thee, if I could but find empty husks to ſatisfie the thirſt of my ſoul, which are only fit for the voluptuous Swines of the world, and can never ſatisfie.</p>
               <p>Thou ſitteſt upon a Throne of grace, to this can we come by Chriſt only; through him we may come boldly, and find mercy in a time of need; and all that come unto thee, come by this; and to this I deſire to approach, that I may find mercy in this time of need; receive me, I beſeech thee, as a returning Prodigal, deſirous
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:34461:176"/>to break off my ſins by repentance and a new life.</p>
               <p>Lord give me that Repentance that I ſhall never repent of; that I may ſearch and try my waies, examine my own heart, and diſcuſs all my actions, what I have done, through the whole courſe of my life let me performe this duty by thy aſſiſtance that I may not run on in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without regret, as they did of whom the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. They ſaid not, <hi>What have I done?</hi> I will therefore make this reflection ſeriouſly, particularly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</p>
               <p>In this Examination I will conſider the bate that cought me, and deceived me, that I may abhor it as a mean, baſe, and vile thing to be put in the ſcales againſt that communion with God, his favour and hopes which the ſoul had in God, which it loſt by that ſin as to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent feeling, and if it ſhould at any time rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force its allurements, I will reject them utterly, and not have to do with them any more.</p>
               <p>I conſider alſo the preſent, and future evils brought upon my ſoul by this ſin, for though I muſt not diſpaire of pardon through the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient merits of my Saviours ſufferings, yet I find my ſelf fearful, and aſhamed to approach the throne of grace, leaſt I ſhould find him a conſuming fire. I am undiſpoſed for every holy duty, and deprived of the aſſiſtance of the Spirit. And not only ſo, but I am as it were left to my ſelf with the tempter, and ſee none to ſuccor me, and I know not what to take in hand with hopes of ſucceſs, I am at a loſs what I ſhould do, becauſe I ſeeme
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:34461:176"/>to have loſt God who hath withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for my ſin, and hides his face. I am alſo made naked, and deſtitute, for he was my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and ſhield, my ſtrength, and refuge, my hope, and helpe in trouble. I have wilfully opened a gap to let in a ſtream of corruptions, a Breach is made in my ſpiritual Caſtle for all the enemies of my ſoul, to break in at, and I am diſpoſed to greater ſins which by little and little creep in, and get ground by degrees till at laſt it reigns uncontrolled, and brings us in the end to a hardned heart, a ſeared conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that cannot repent, and eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>I conſider alſo what might, and ought to have drawn me from my ſin to the contrary virtue. What ſtrength of humane reaſon, what moral precepts, natural modeſty, and ſhame, fear of being ſeen, examples of moral, ſerious, and religious men to the contrary ſerenity, of mind, the publick good, and my own private good, contentation, and tranſquility, and happineſs with many more motives from the light of nature and good education ready to inform and reſtrain a mind willing to be virtuous.</p>

The life of faith, the fear of God, and his alſeeing eye, the terror of the curſe upon the diſobedient. Hope of Heaven, and eternal recompences to the obedient, the exceeding and eternal weight of glory which is laid up for us, the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precious promiſes, able not only to ſupport the ſoul of a believer in the greateſt difficulties, but alſo to raviſh it which exceſs of joy under the greateſt ſufferings. Beſides if I had no
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:34461:177"/>ſuch light of nature, no education, no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the ſcriptures, and humane precepts, no knowledg of hiſtories of Gods dealing in judgment with other ſinners who have felt the truth of all the threatnings denounced againſt ſinners, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> and the ſcriptures, and other writings teſtify the <hi>Jews</hi> did, and all noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinners have done, and daily do; if I had no promiſes to allure, no threatnings to drive me, no conſcience to teſtify unto me, no teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of other men in all ages both wicked, and righteous; yet this one argument were perſwaſive enough to have deterred me from wickedneſs to the ſervice of God, namely, my dependance on him for the neceſſaries, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of life, my ſupplys, my ſuſtentation and preſervation from imminent dangers, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly ſurpriſing me. This might be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make me bewaile my own improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and folly in caſting away my ſuccour, my hope, my ſuſtentation, ſafeguard, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, for that which hath not profited me. I therefore with grief of heart bewail my ſelf. But that which may cumulate more grief is to conſider the ungratitude of my ſinful ſoul for ſo many mercies received which have tranſported me with admiration. As when I received form the hands of the Lord hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that I built not, and wealth that I laboured not for, whereby I was delivered from getting my bread with the ſweat of my brow, and the labor of my mind, and body, in pain, and ſorrow, with continual carping, and caring, and reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the benefit whereof I continually enjoy with comfort, therefore my duty of gratitude
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:34461:177"/>obligeth me to conſider what I ſhall render to God, and to uſe theſe mercies to his honour and glory, and not to abuſe them to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in ſinning againſt him. And when I have done the contrary, I have dealt unworthily with ſo good a God; for if <hi>Hanna</hi> would needs retribute for one mercy, what muſt I do for ſo many? The many deliverances that God hath wrought for me in bringing me out of troubles which I have ſometimes brought upon my ſelf, ſometimes my enimies have brought upon me, ſometimes the hand of God hath brought upon me, and my relations, either for our ſins, or for our trials, out of all which the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me; ſo that I can teſtify, and ſet to my ſeale, that God is true, and hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all his gracious promiſes to me, that he hath made to them that fear him. He hath been with me in ſix troubles, and in the ſeventh he hath not forſaken me, his deliverances have exceeded both theſe numbers, therefore I muſt confeſs that he hath alſo verified his largeſt promiſes to me, ſaying, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> And alſo when he ſaith, <hi>No weapon formed againſt thee ſhall proſper.</hi> And when he ſaith, <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> For his mercies have been greater than my deſires, and my tongue would fail me to recount them.</p>
               <p>All which fly in my face, and teſtify againſt me when I ſin, for how can I recount all his benefits which I have received from him, upon which I live, beginning with that of being born of virtuous parents. And all the deliverances which he hath wrought for me, in abundance of mercy, and chiefly that he hath delivered my
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:34461:178"/>ſoul from Hell. But I muſt reflect upon my ſin with ſhame, and confuſion of face, with loathing, and abhorring my ſelf in ſackcloth and aſhes, with faſting, and depriving my ſelf of all comforts, and injoyments, with humiliation, and abaſing my ſelf with earneſt and humble ſupplications, ſighs, and tears, of a contrite heart; but when I conſider the vows, promiſes, and proteſtations which I have made to God in my time of trouble, when I ſought to God for my deliverance, and that he did pluck me as a brand out of the fire, and did hear my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and delivered me, and did grant my requeſts above my deſire, or hope, as he did <hi>Jacobs.</hi> Theſe broken vows put me to ſhame, and cauſe me to abhor my ſelf, and with <hi>Ephraim</hi> to ſmite upon my breaſt, deſiring in my heart that I could do any thing whereby I might but undo one ſinful action, or that I could expiate the ſame by any ſufferings, but my conſcience tells me that all I can do or ſuffer, through the whole courſe of my life, will not be ſufficient to expiate, or attone for one ſin, ſo as to make me innocent again. Therefore I have reſolved, and vowd to ſin no more. And I have wiſhed my ſelf dead, that I might no more ſin, and I have reſolved to ſeparate my ſelf from the world, that I may ſpend all my time in ſerving God, who hath not dealt by me after my ſins.</p>
               <p>Thy word (O Lord) hath ſhewed me, that if thy people repent them of their ſins, and forſake them, though they be as ſcarlet, thou wilt make them white as ſnow, and thou wilt abundantly pardon them, and thou wilt repent thee of the evil which thou bringeſt upon them.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:34461:178"/>If <hi>Ahab</hi> go mourning, thou wilt not bring the evil in his days, and all thy threatinings are only conditional, unleſs we repent. So the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Ninivie</hi> diverted thy wrath by turning unto thee, and ſeeking thee, with faſtings, and prayers. This duty all the Prophets taught. This St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt preached, Saying, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> This our Bleſſed Saviour, and his Apoſtles taught. Therefore let me practiſe this ſo neceſſary a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but unleſs thou inableſt me with thy grace, and unleſs thou giveſt me repentance, I cannot have it of my ſelf, becauſe my heart is hard of it ſelf and thou only doſt mollify it by the word, and thy Spirit. I will therefore beſeech thee for this grace, ſaying with <hi>Ephraim, Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Turn thou me (O Lord) and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord, for of my ſelf, I am under thy Chaſtiſements untamed, as a Bullock unaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the yoak.</hi> But if thou turneſt me, thou wilt open my ear by diſcipline, thou wilt open my eyes, and mollify my hard heart; I ſhall be inſtructed, convinced of my errours, and ſmite upon my breaſt, and repent, and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Thus <hi>Ephraim</hi> did <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.19. <hi>Surely after I was turned I repented, after I was inſtructed I ſmote upon my thigh, I was aſhamed, and confund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lord we aſcribe this, and all our graces unto thee, thou workeſt in us both to will, and to do, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he labourd more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly than all, yet not he, but the grace of God in him.</hi> It is not ſufficient that thou comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt all men to repent, but that godly ſorrow which worketh repentance is from thee alſo.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:34461:179"/>By this we are ſorrowfull for our ſins, for ſins ſake, and not only for fear of the puniſhment, as <hi>Eſau,</hi> when he ſought repentance carefully with tears becauſe of his loſs, as alſo <hi>Pharo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his ſins, but the plagues being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, he returned to his ſin again. And the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when God conſumed their dayes in vanity, and their years in trouble, and when he ſlew them they ſought him, but within a while they forgot God. And God alone can give this ſorrow, becauſe he alone can open the eyes to let us ſee our ſelves, &amp; know our ſelves, and let me ever ſeek my light in him (<hi>Act.</hi> 26.8.) <hi>For God is light, and all light is from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spirit ſhews us our ſelves in the glaſs of the law, which ſhewes us our ſinfulneſs, and our loſt undone condition by reaſon thereof, and that ſin is the worſt of evils, becauſe it is the cauſe of all other evils, and without this conviction we cannot repent, becauſe we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of light in our ſelves, to ſee our ſelves, for by ſin our underſtanding is darkned. (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18.) And 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.11. <hi>He that hateth his Brother, walketh in darkneſs, and knoweth not whither he goeth.</hi> He wanteth light, and ſight too, <hi>Job</hi> 24.13. <hi>They rebel againſt the light, and know not the waies thereof.</hi> Naturally we ſhut our eyes againſt the light as the <hi>Jews, Joh.</hi> 12.37. Though Chriſt Jeſus had done many miracles among them, yet they believed not in him, though alſo he ſpeak as no man ſpake, his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being judges. And becauſe our natural eſtate is a ſtate of unbelief, therefore we in that eſtate oppoſe the light of Gods word as is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.4. Though one ſhould come
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:34461:179"/>out of Hell, they would not believe.</p>
               <p>Again, I find I cannot repent of my ſelf, without Gods grace inclining me: Becauſe naturally my heart is proud, and unhumbled, and ſees no uſe of Chriſt. And therefore it muſt be humbled by grace, for Chriſt came only to ſeek, and to ſave that which was loſt, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their loſt condition; their Spiritual ſickneſs, and fly to Chriſt as the man ſlayer did to the Cities of refuge, or the prodigal after he could not find relief in the husks, would then returne to his Fathers houſe. Again, I find in my ſelf that my nature, when dejected, is inclined to repentance too violently, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> who ſorrowed over much, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like that of <hi>Judas,</hi> ready to make away my ſelf, if Gods ſupernatural grace did not help me, by applying ſome word of comfort out of the Scripture. Then if my repentance cauſe not a dejection, I fear it is too cold, like that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when God ſlew them, then they ſought him, but preſently they forgat that God was their redeemer. Therefore I pray for Gods grace ſo to convince me of ſin, that I may be alſo convinced of righteouſneſs too, for he hath ſaid, <hi>That if we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive them.</hi> That I may not ſorrow as thoſe who are without hope, nor hang down my head like a bulruſh, for a day, but that I may ſorrow to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and better obedience, for unleſs it attain to that end, and proceed from theſe cauſes, I muſt not account it a godly ſorrow working to repentance. But a worldly ſorrow or a deviliſh ſorrow, for they alſo fear, and tremble, but
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:34461:180"/>they cannot turn unto God, with their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and endeavours, <hi>and bring forth fruit meet for Repentance,</hi> nor be renewed in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their mind, which is the only true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>I find in my ſelf ſometimes motions of the fleſh, ſuggeſting that I have time enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. But I pray that whilſt it is to day, I may lay hold on the ſeaſons of Grace, that I may remember my Creator in the time of my youth; leaſt ſin grow to a habit, and by cuſtom ſeem to be no ſin, and becomes a ſecond Nature, that it cannot be parted withal. And in the firſt of <hi>Proverbs</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>Becauſe when I called, ye anſwered not; therefore ye ſhall call and I will not anſwer;</hi> which our Saviour teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that the Jews found true, when he wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he rejected thoſe who made excuſes when they were invited.</p>
               <p>I fear, and am jealous, that my Repentance is not ſo ſound as it ought to be, becauſe I am not ſo ſenſible of the evil of ſin as I ought: for though immediately after the commiſſion of ſin, I apprehend great evil in it, in making me liable to all Gods Judgements, here and hereafter; and that it deprives me of all good. Firſt, my hopes of Eternal happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and the great and precious promiſes made to the obedient. And if not that, for there remaineth hope of Repentance, yet there is great loſs, and puniſhment to all ſinners though they repent. As <hi>David</hi> found when he numbred the people: When God offered him his choice of the three Judgements. And when he denounced that Judgement againſt his
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:34461:180"/>Family. That the Sword ſhould never depart from it. And <hi>Lot</hi> for his drunkenneſs, and luſt, ſuffered ſhame, all the days of his life, and the curſe upon his Seed. Beſides the outward loſſes, I cannot ſufficiently value the inward Spiritual loſs; when I have no acceſs to the Throne of Grace with any confidence, but am afraid to approach to it: nor can have any comfort in meditating of God's Word and Promiſes, as if I heard a voice, ſaying, <hi>Why doſt thou take my Laws into thy Mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt to be reformed, and haſt caſt my Commandments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thy back;</hi> or, if I do meditate of Gods Word, and his Promiſes, and his Goodneſs, I find not ſuch ſweetneſs and delight in my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations as I did before I had ſinned. On the contrary, I find theſe Spiritual loſſes: Firſt, Great advantage given to my Spiritual Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to inſult over me, as if I were guilty of all ſins, by this one ſin, and the ſame diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that lead me to this, would lead me into all ſins; (which God forbid.) And my own Conſcience is ready to accuſe me of all ſins for this one. Alledging to me that it was only Gods reſtraint by afflictions, that hindred me from falling into all ſins; and that now he is like to leave me, becauſe I have left him; and ſo I am like to be as guilty as any Man ever was. Next, that he finds another advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to tempt me to a further degree of ſin; ſuggeſting to my mind, that I am ſo far enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Sin already, that I am loſt, and God hath caſt me off, and I can be no more undone, if I proceed further in ſin, to which ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if I am but once drawn to yield, he will
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:34461:181"/>eaſily draw me deeper and deeper; but I pray that he may never draw me to the belief of this. A further evil I find as great as any; that the guilt of all my ſins, both of Omiſſion and Commiſſion that ever I was guilty of in all my Life-time, now flyeth in my face with aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as if they were unpardonable (ſo doth my conſcience aggravate them) and my Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual adverſary is ready to perſwade me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, becauſe I lie under ſo much guilt; and God ſo juſt, that he puniſheth ſin where ever he findeth it, as he did in our firſt Parents, and all Mankind for the guilt of one ſin. All which evils, and many more, which ſin bringeth and hath brought upon others, I am ſenſible of with fear and grief in a great meaſure, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the commiſſion of ſin. Yet I find it hard to keep in my mind a continual dread and fear of every ſin, and watch againſt it ſo ſtrictly as I ought, though I have felt the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of it. And though I can ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, my Iniquities are gone over my Head, and are a ſore burden too heavy for me to bear. I</hi> pray therefore, that they may ever be in my ſight, that I may be ſenſible of the burthen of them, and of all the evil in them; and weep for them day and night as he did for his, and may bring forth fruit meet for repentance. That God ſeeing it, may turn his face from my ſins, and may blot out all my miſdeeds, when he ſhall behold my heart broke, and beaten to pieces by the burthen and weight of my ſins, which ſacrifice the Lord doth not deſpiſe. And when he ſhall behold me abhorring my ſelf, he may not abhor me. But when I confeſs them,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:34461:181"/>am ſorry for them, and forſake them, he may blot them out, and my ſoul may be aſſured that they are pardoned in Chriſt Jeſus, that he hath borne them. And that he had an eye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in his ſufferings, and hath waſhed me clean with his blood, and made me white as ſnow, that by his ſtripes I am healed, and that my name is written in that free pardon that he hath purchaſed. And that I owe unto him all that I have or can do for this mercy. Though I have forſaken God as an adulterous wife doth her husband for other lovers, and given my affections to others, and taken it off from God, whereby I muſt confeſs that I have deſerved that God ſhould caſt me off; yet becauſe he hath declared, that though a man will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive again ſuch a wife, yet God will receive again ſuch people, and invites them to return unto him, therefore I returne again unto God, truſting in this his word of promiſe, that he will receive me again into his love, and favour, with everlaſting mercy, and kindneſs.</p>
               <p>And I will henceforth reſolve never more to entertain any thought that may tend to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my affections from ſo good a God, or corrupt my love to him, but will watch ſtrictly againſt ſuch as would allure me, and deceive me, and pray to God to aſſiſt me, ſince theſe my ſpiritual enemies are too ſubtil, and too ſtrong for me alone to deal withall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his aſſiſtance, which he hath faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to lend me, when I heartily, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly crave it in my time of need, and diſtreſs. And then I ſhall be able to reſiſt, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thoſe that allure me to betray me, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34461:182"/>performe and keep my vows which were firſt made for me in my baptiſme, and often ſince that renewed by me in times of trouble, and imminent dangers, and at the ſacrament of the Euchariſt, eſpecially when I firſt I enjoyed the happy priviledg of thoſe holy myſteries, alſo when firſt I eſpouſed my ſelf, by my own choiſe, unto my Maker.</p>
               <p>I am prone to look upon my own ſins as little. Oh that I could have the ſame appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of my own ſins, as I have had of other mens, for I have ſaid, <hi>If I had ſined as they have, I would have ſpent all my life in weeping, faſting, and praying, cloathing my ſelf in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, waſhing my bed with my tears.</hi> If ſo be the Lord would heare me, and have mercy upon me, and pardon me. And how neere thoſe very ſins have I come.</p>
               <p>Though I cannot attain the ſame degree of ſorrow for my ſins, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after he denied his Saviour he went out, and wept bitterly, and as it is written of his life, he wore channels in his eyes, by his frequent tears for that ſin. Though I cannot with <hi>David, Waſh my bed, and water my couch with my tears, and mingle my drink with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, becauſe of my ſin;</hi> yet will I endeavour to ſupply what is lacking in the degree of my ſorrow, by the duration, and continuance of it. And make ſin the only matter of my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and thereby I ſhall be better inabled to avoid my falling into the ſame again, and though I cannot waſh my ſelf clean from the guilt of my ſins by mine own repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the blood of Chriſt only can cleanſe us
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:34461:182"/>from our ſins, yet this is the condition neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make us ſubjects capable of being waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood of Chriſt, which is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to us in the Lords Supper to waſh and cleanſe, and heal our penitent broken hearts. Therefore will I look unto him hanging upon the Croſs, and ſheding his precious blood to make ſatisfaction for my ſins, and bearing the iniquities of us all, that we might have pardon of ſin, and peace of conſcience in him. And thoſe which he hath invited to come unto him that he may give them reſt, are ſuch only as are weary, and heavy laden. And he only can give it, becauſe the ſoul that receiveth it muſt come empty handed, as it is intimated, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Come buy Wine and Milk without mony, and without price.</hi> Such whoſe conſciences are weary, and labour under the burden of ſin, and go mourning by reaſon thereof, and are ready to ſink, and faint under Gods chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch a one can find no reſt in the creature, nor in it ſelf, till it come to Chriſt, then mans miſery is Chriſts opportunity. <hi>They that are ſick need a phyſitian, not they that are hole. Neminem venientem arcet a gracia ſua.</hi> There are none excepted out of this free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, therefore not I. All that will come may, all that did look up to the Brazen Serpent were healed.</p>
               <p>I thus being burdened with the weight of my ſins, and weary of them, and fainting under them, languiſhing for want of comfort, and eaſement, find this invitation from him that is ready to relieve me, and all men freely, without any merit of mine. Beſeech him to take away
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:34461:183"/>this my burthen, to give me a new heart, and to heal my ſoul. That he would give me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his blood, even the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my ſins, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.2. And ſeal it to my conſcience, that he hath borne my iniquities, and hath taken them away, and caſt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom of the Sea, that he would give me this balme of <hi>Gillead</hi> (his precious blood) to cleanſe me from all my ſins, and to heal my wounded conſcience, and by his word to heal my corrupt nature, I come unto him for faith in him, which I have not of my ſelf, it is the gift of God, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I come and beg his Spirit to quicken me with a new life, Ephe.</hi> 2.1. <hi>You hath he quickned who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> That he would take away the Spirit of bondage, and give me the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I may call him Father, and obey him cheerfully from the principle of love, which will make my ſervices accepted, and prove my repentance true, which will not, The hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of my head.</p>

               <p>THE excellency of this grace is ſuch, that it makes all other things excellent, and without it, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, charity is no charity, piety and charity, and all other graces, and vertues, are no gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without faith; it is the ſalt of all holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:34461:183"/>which makes them acceptable ſacrifices to God. It is excellent in its original. It is the gift of God. It is ſo alſo in its fruit, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and its final end is equally excellent, <hi>viz.</hi> Salvation. There is no degree of it ſo little, but is of infinite vertue, it makes us overcome all difficulties in doing and ſuffering the good will and pleaſure of Almighty God. The firſt degree of faith is to believe that God is. The 2d. degree, to believe that he is a rewarder of them that deligently ſeek him; but this doth not ſave, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> had this belief when he perſecuted the Church. But to believe in Gods promiſes of ſalvation through Chriſt Jeſus is ſaving faith, as it is ſaid by our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> This is ſaving faith, and this is the principal act of faith, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is the principal object of faith, and every act of grace, is a branch of this grace, hope, charity, patience, humility; unleſs they are acted and ſet on work by faith in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> In obedience to God, believing his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our works through his Son, they are nothing more than the moral vertues.</p>
               <p>This grace is that which gives moſt glory to God, becauſe it believes things that are inviſible to ſenſe and reaſon aſſuredly as if they were viſible. It is called the evidence of things not ſeen, knowing that Gods bare word is the greateſt aſſurance, therefore the Scripture ſaith of <hi>Abraham, That he believed, and gave glory to God;</hi> and he ſtaggered not, though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was againſt reaſon and ſenſe in regard of the age of himſelf and his wife <hi>Sarah.</hi> And though Gods command of Sacrifiſing his Son
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:34461:184"/>
                  <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſeemed to be repugnant and contrary to his promiſe, yet he believed ſtedfaſtly in the truth of God, though it ſeemed repugnant; ſo God put his faith to it, to try it, and he denied his ſenſe and reaſon to believe God, and to obey him.</p>
               <p>It conſiſts not in one act, but it is a habit, and for that reaſon the life of a believer is call'd the life of faith. Agreeable to which it is ſaid of the life of <hi>Abraham, That he lived in the land of promiſe as in a ſtrange Country, looking for a City which had foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> And this he did during his life, ſo that he never had the ſight of that he believed, but lived upon the promiſe only and upon God.</p>
               <p>This life of faith is a mortifying, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying life, for <hi>Abraham</hi> lived in the land of promiſe as a ſtranger, not as a home dweller, freely and boldly enjoying it as his own. But uſing the world as if he uſed it not, not living upon the world, nor by ſenſe, though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was of worldly things. St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth of himſelf that he lived this life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life which I live, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> For faith working by love, by the Spirit of Chriſt unites us to Chriſt, in all union as our Root, our Head, our Brother, our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, then it perſwades us of the alſufficiency of God which ſupports the ſoul, wherefore God made it the inducement to <hi>Abraham</hi> why he ſhould walk before him in perfection, and whatever is wanting in the creature, faith thus acted makes it up in God, as is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. <hi>Lord thou haſt been our dwelling place
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:34461:184"/>through all generations.</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi> Becauſe God is the delight of the ſoul <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>Job.</hi> 27.10. But it is ſaid of the hypocrite, <hi>Will he alwaies call upon the Lord, will he delight himſelf in him?</hi> No he will not, for he loves not.</p>
               <p>This St. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth that he practiſed ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>To me to live is Chriſt, to dye is gain.</hi> He lived upon Chriſt, and he in him, Not only in the Apoſtles eſteem was Chriſt all to him. But Chriſt teſtifieth of himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.34. <hi>The bread of God is he which cometh down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and giveth life to the world.</hi> Therefore might <hi>Job</hi> eſteem it more than his neceſſary food, if he be the eternal food of the ſoul, which gives it a new eternal life, and maintains it, ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrengthening the principles of this life, and reparing the decaies of it. There is nothing needful, or comfortable which graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoules have not enjoyed in God, and Chriſt, <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 5. <hi>Lord thou art my light and my ſalvation, whom then ſhall I fear, thou art the ſtrength of my life of whom then ſhall I be affraid? Pſal.</hi> 119.57. <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord, I have ſaid that I will keep thy word.</hi> If God be ſufficient for himſelf he is ſufficient for us. All is yours, and ye are Chriſts, all the things in the world can afford little comfort to the rational ſoul, they can alitle divert it from its grief, but are ſo far from yeilding true ſatisfaction, that the more it drinks, the more it thirſts, but he that drinks of the water of life ſhall never thirſt more. He that eates of the true bread which came down from Heaven ſhall be ſatisfied in all his deſires and appetites, more than they
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:34461:185"/>whoſe Corne, Wine, and Oyl, is increaſed, and may ſay truly, my joy ſhall be in the Lord, as he did, and every child of God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this duty in this ſaying, <hi>Rejoice in the Lord ye Righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This excellent grace makes the ſoul happy wherein it is, becauſe he that poſſeſſeth it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth Chriſt and all the benefits and priviledges that he hath purchaſed, that incomparable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of juſtification firſt, as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and laſt <hi>v.</hi> and the 5th. and firſt <hi>v. Who was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace. Therefore being juſtified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This peace is a ſecond benefit, or priviledg which faith derives from Chriſt, a third follows, by whom alſo we have acceſs by faith into this grace wherein we ſtand, the favors of God wherein we ſtand, or the bleſſed condition of juſtified, and ſanctified perſons to which we come by Chriſt through faith, and rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God; both our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and future condition is made happy by faith, and it aſſures to us that happineſs. It followes, and not only ſo, but we glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations alſo, knowing that tribulation works patience.</p>
               <p>So that calamities are by faith made conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory, through the ſanctified uſe which faith makes of them, they are not only made not formidable, as <hi>David</hi> his fears vaniſhed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon God, which he expreſſed ſaying, <hi>What time I am afraid, I will put my truſt in thee, Pſal.</hi> 56.3. He made uſe of his faith in
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:34461:185"/>the time of his fears, as he did alſo in the time of his wants, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. <hi>The Lord is my ſhepherd, therefore I ſhall lack nothing.</hi> So that faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldens the Servants of God againſt all evil. Chriſt gives and enſures them theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, partly by the teſtimony of his Spirit, partly by faith in his merit, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.12. <hi>In whom we boldneſs and acceſs with confidence through faith in him, Heb.</hi> 10.19. <hi>We have entrance into the holieſt through the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Spirit aſſures us, that all the Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which Chriſt hath purchaſed for his people, are ours, and cauſeth us to rejoyce in them as ours.</p>
               <p>That all the promiſes are ours, and cauſeth us to rely upon them; becauſe we are aſſured that Chriſt is ours by Faith; when he is laid hold on as ours; all things are ours: then it follows, that we have peace of Conſcience, and tranquility in our Souls, for he is our Peace, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. And we acquieſce in him becauſe we have choſen him for our portion.</p>
               <p>He is reconcilation between God and us, he ſatisfieth our debts, makes God at peace with us, and our conſcences at peace in themſelves, and our ſouls ſatisfied as having nothing more that they can deſire, but more communion with God, as that which ſatisfieth it. We know that God hath no wrath at all towards us, nor our conſciences any dread, or fear of Gods wrath, or any terror, but aſſurance of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and love, and that our ſins are waſhed away by the blood of Chriſt, according to that in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Having made peace through the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:34461:186"/>blood of his Croſs, by him to reconcile all things to himſelf.</hi> 21. <hi>And you that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works,</hi> yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death to preſent you holy, and unbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, and unreprovable in his ſight, if you continue in the faith.</p>
               <p>Hence the ſoul aſſures it ſelf that none of the works of Gods ſeverity have any wrath at all againſt it, for in the 24. <hi>v.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He rejoyceth in his ſufferings.</hi> But poſitively they are aſſured of their adoption, and of the love and friendſhip of God, that he will preſerve them, ſupply them, teach them, heal them, guide and ſupport them, viſit them with ſpiritual conſolations, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and that all things ſhall work together for their good, which makes them willing to ſubmit to Gods chaſtiſements, as it is <hi>Pſal. For thy ſake are we killed all the day long, yet do we not forſake thee.</hi> This keeps them from murmuring, and from covetouſneſs. The nature of it is, that it can only be where the Son of peace is. This peace is a league offenſive, and defenſive, whereby the ſoul hates ſin, and all that God hates, and loves holineſs, and all that God loves. That ſalutation which our bleſſed Lord perſcribed to his Apoſtles muſt needs be the moſt excellent and deſirable, that ſaies, <hi>Peace be to this houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This peace makes all other things at peace with us, for he is ſaid <hi>To make a league with the foules of the air and the beaſts of the field,</hi> for us, in <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.17. <hi>When a mans waies pleaſe God, he makes his enemies at peace
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:34461:186"/>with him. Pſal.</hi> 91.10. <hi>The plague ſhall not come neer his dwelling, or if it do, it ſhall be no plague, Rom.</hi> 8.31. <hi>If God be with us, who ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</hi> That is, though they are againſt us, the ſting is taken out.</p>
               <p>The excellency of it is ſo great, that it paſſeth human underſtanding.</p>
               <p>It is an everlaſting peace, it doth not forſake us in the time of trouble, nor in the hour of death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>His mercies are called ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It makes us peaceable with men to thoſe we have offended; it makes us willing to ſatisfy them, and willing to pardon thoſe that have offended us, but the wicked are like the rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sea alwaies unquiet.</p>
               <p>It quickens the ſoul to holy duties, the ſoul conſiders what it ſhall render to the Lord for all his mercies towards it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. <hi>Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgiveth all thy ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The excellency of it muſt needs be great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the legacy which Chriſt dying left to his Church, not as the world gives, gave he it to them, but more largely, liberally, and bountifully, and abſolutely, without any limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of time, or condition. <hi>David</hi> calls it great peace which they have which love Gods word, but yet he ſaith that many are the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the righteous. That which followeth makes amends. The Lord delivereth them out of all, and the Lord will ſtand by them, and deliver them, as we know he did the three children out of the fiery furnace, and <hi>Daniel</hi> out of the Lyons den, and <hi>Job</hi> out of the fiery
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:34461:187"/>Trials. The fruits of righteouſneſs are ſown in peace, not in diſcord; they which love peace ſowe them. And this ſhield of faith is both an offenſive and defenſive weapon, whereby theſe holy warriours in their ſpiritual warfare fought the Lords battels, under the bloody banner of the Croſs of Chriſt, who for the glory that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame; theſe follow the lamb, and ſuffer with him, that they may alſo raigne with him, and take joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, knowing that they have a more enduring ſubſtance in Heaven. And willingly they ſpend and are ſpent for God.</p>
               <p>Faith is that which fixes the heart upon things eternal, and holdeth it as by an anchor, when in the world there can be no fixation, but becauſe of the raribility of the objects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the inſtability of the ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> The mind of the natural man, all is faſt and looſe, and nothing can be truſted in. But faith truſteth in the Lord, becauſe it knows the faithfulneſs of his promiſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Except you believe you can not be eſtabliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith is that which inables us to walk with God, becauſe it believeth in, and truſteth to his alſufficiency, bounty, and goodneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon them, caſting its care upon God, ſo that it makes the converſation of a believer to be without covetouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This holy dependancy upon God, <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. With the benefits he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thereby in theſe words, <hi>My ſoul hangeth
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:34461:187"/>on thee, thy right hand alſo ſhall uphold me.</hi> They that ſeek the hurt of my ſoul, they ſhall go under the earth, but he would rejoyce in God.</p>
               <p>Faith is that which gives the ſoul an intereſt in God, and in Chriſt Jeſus from whence flows all true comfort that the ſoul can deſire, and reciprocally it gives God an intereſt in us, that we ſhould be wholly his, both ſoul and body living, and dying. As to the intereſt of God in us, 'tis ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.94. <hi>I am thine,</hi> and in divers other Pſalmes, <hi>O ſave thy Servant,</hi> and by the Apoſtle, <hi>Whether we live therefore or dye we are the Lords. David</hi> makes uſe of this intereſt of God in him as an argument for him to hear his prayers, and deliver and ſuccour him in his need, but they ſeem more doubtful when they make uſe of Gods intereſt in them, than when they make uſe of their intereſt in God, for then they are high in their confidence, and faith in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. <hi>I truſted in thee, for I ſaid, thou art my God.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. <hi>I will love thee O Lord my ſtrength. The Lord is my ſtony rock, and my defence, my Saviour, my God, and my might in whom I will truſt, my buckler, the horne alſo of my ſalvation, and my refuge,</hi> 2. <hi>v. I will call upon the Lord which is worthy to be praiſed, ſo ſhall I be ſafe from my enemies.</hi> 3. <hi>v. The ſorrows of death compaſſed me, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of ungodlineſs made me afraid,</hi> 4. <hi>v. The paines of hell came about me, the ſnares of death overtook me. In my trouble I will call upon the Lord, and complain unto my God, ſo ſhall he hear my voice, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>I will rejoyce in God my ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The aſſurance of our intereſt in God, inables
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:34461:188"/>us to lay hold on every promiſe, and every priviledg of the Servants of God, and to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge God upon his word, with confidence, as it is expreſſed in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.59. <hi>Remember thy word unto thy Servant wherein thou haſt cauſed me to put my truſt.</hi> He looks upon his faith in the promiſe as that which obliged God to the performance, and God looks upon it ſo too, as it is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.14. <hi>Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me I will deliver him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. No hurt was found upon <hi>Daniel</hi> becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.13, 18. The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed becauſe they truſted and relied upon the Lord, <hi>Pſal</hi> 37.40. <hi>He ſhall deliver them from the ungodly, becauſe they put their truſt in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore our Bleſſed Saviour prayed for his Diſciples faith that it might not fail, when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan deſired to Winow them, as wheat is Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowed. Could Satans fiery darts have been quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and he baffled by this reply, I believe as the Church believes as ſome pretend this had been eaſy for them to have ſaid, and ſo quitted themſelves of all his winnowing, or had they not ſo much faith, as to ſay ſo, or not ſo much cunning as they that teach us that; but if it did not profit the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſay that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children and not baſtards, no more will it profit us to ſay we believe as the Church believe, or as <hi>Abraham</hi> believed; unleſs we do the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and can ſhew our faith by our works, for they are of the Devil that do his works.</p>
               <p>And which of all the promiſes do they mean, or which threatnings, which precept, or which
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:34461:188"/>commandment, or word of the Goſpel of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? and if they mean all theſe, yet by referring to anothers belief, they confeſs there own ignorance, and imply that they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give an accompt of their faith, nor know what it is that they believe, and how then can they believe, for they cannot believe in him of whom they have not heard, therefore their belief is a lye and they infidels, but he to whom they make this anſwer muſt be ſuppoſed to know the belief of the Church, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended belief better than they, and ſo it is becauſe they are not permitted the reading of that Goſpel whereof they pretend belief.</p>
               <p>This ſaying of theſe deceivers came from the ſame <hi>Minerva,</hi> as that ſaying of <hi>Claudius Caeſar</hi> did, and is the parallel of it, ſpeaking of a certain buſineſs he pronounced gravely as if he had read it in a book. That he was of the ſame opinion with them who had offered true things. The words in the Author are <hi>Secundum eos ſe ſentire qui vera propoſuiſſent. Suetonius.</hi> It followeth <hi>(ibid.) Propter quae uſque eo eviluit ut paſſim ut propalam contemptui eſſet, &amp;c.</hi> And I can ſee no reaſon why the aſſerters and upholders of this ſilly ſaying (which they ſo magnify and affect) ſhould not fall into a parity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for ſo doing</p>
               <p>But that ſandy foundation of theirs; That ignorance is the Mother of Devotion, (and 'tis true of their devotion) can bear no other ſuperſtructure, than ignorance of the faith, and ignorance of the Scripture, nor can it otherwiſe be ſupported, but life eternal conſiſts in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Every prudent man deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in knowledg.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:34461:189"/>
               <p>But whenever ſubtilty &amp; craft is requiſite, there they uſe it; and where ignorance is helpful to their deſigns, there that is appiled. I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to nothing more fitly than to briars which take root and grow at both their ends, and whereever they lay hold of the ſilly ſheep, they tear off the fleece.</p>
               <p>But that faith which makes us the Sons of God, and gives life eternal, muſt be more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and be able to give an account of it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> To know God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, according to the promiſes of illumination, <hi>They ſhall all know</hi> &amp;c. And know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him muſt receive him, and believe in his name, as in <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, to them that believe in his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The object of faith which is ſaid to be the evidence of things not ſeen generally, is God, and the truth of God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12. which is his word; we muſt believe the truth of his threatnings, as well as the truth of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.19. This belief ſaved <hi>Noah,</hi> and his family from the deſtruction of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and this was commanded in him, for a worthy act of faith, and by this <hi>Lot</hi> eſcaped when <hi>Sodom</hi> was deſtroyed, and his doubting wife made a perpetual monument or ſpectacle for her infidelity, the chief and ſpecial object is Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.37. If we muſt leve Chriſt, then is Chriſt the principle, the cauſe, efficient and final, the matter, and the forme of that life. His example our pattern, and his will ours; to me to live is Chriſt is meant in ſome or in all theſe ſenſes, for faith verifies it in them all.</p>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:34461:189"/>
               <p>He is the end of our converſation, becauſe we can deſire no more, nor can we need any more, if we have him; he is the matter and forme of it, becauſe the natural life is drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this, and is made ſpiritual, as it is ſaid, <hi>If we have known Chriſt in the fleſh, yet henceforth know we him no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The holy ſoul doth not injoy its life, if it doth not feel Chriſt living in it by his Spirit quickning its graces, it crys, <hi>O miſerable man that I am,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As faith tells the inſtrument, and meanes whereby we attain the greateſt good, ſo it is the Armour that defends us from the greateſt evils, therefore ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Above all take the ſhield of faith, whereby ye ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> Whereby he commends faith above all the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Armour, ſhewing the cauſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation from the exceeding virtue of it, that it inables them to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, the virtue of it is univerſal againſt the worſt of evils, if it be taken, that is, if it be uſed. It muſt be uſed in the relying act, and in the aplying act, ſtaying our ſelves upon the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.5. <hi>Commit our way unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Applying act is when the ſoul can ſay his righteouſnes is mine to juſtify me, his blood which he ſhed upon the Croſs, an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for my ſins, his Spirit mine to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me. The fiery darts which Satan ſhoots are firſt the guilt of ſin, then afflictions, inward and out ward; thoſe who were ſtung by the fiery Serpents could not be curſed, unleſs they
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:34461:190"/>looked up to the brazen Serpent. Faith ſees that the blood which Chriſt ſhed for ſinners was ſhed for my ſin, that he had an eye unto me in his ſufferings. A 2 Way faith quenches the fiery darts of Satan by ſeeing that ſin is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, if ſo then it can have no power to condem the ſoul. A 3 Way is to ſee afflictions to be a means of grace, that they ſanctify us, and work for us a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. And to ſee God in the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons working for our good, and keeping us from the hurt which men intended to us; <hi>I will be with thee in the fire, and in the water, that the fire ſhall not burne thee, nor the water hurt thee, Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>I will keep him ſecretly from the ſtrife of tongues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This made the ſuffering Martyrs more than conquerors through Chriſt that loved us, and gave his life for us, therefore they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuffer for him, and lay down their lives for the teſtimony of the Goſpel, to take joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the ſpoiling of their goods, and to think all too little for God, for whom they ſuffered it; therefore let us ſet before us our bleſſed Saviours ſuffering, who endured for us ſuch bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paines, mocking, and contradiction of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, leſt we faint in our minds, and are weary of the Croſs of Chriſt. Let us alſo ſet before us the examples of the Prophets, Apoſtles and Martyrs, and the examples of our own memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Our late King whoſe head was anointed with holy oyle, yet his Majeſty trampled upon with the greateſt indignities, and when the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of his ſubjects, a common Souldier ſpit in his face, uſed no reproof, and he that was Gods
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:34461:190"/>vicegerent of the Crown was humbled, to be Chriſts vicegerent of his Croſs, a rare and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful example of ſuffering patiently the good will and pleaſure of God.</p>
               <p>Our imitation of his virtues ſhall be a laſting monument of his Glory.</p>
               <q>Aere ceu vacuo pendentia Mauſolaea. <bibl>Mart.</bibl>
               </q>
               <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> went far in this, as when one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject fellow curſed him, and threw durt at him, he let him alone ſaying <hi>Who can tell whether God will requite good for his railing.</hi> And God did not fail him, becauſe his faith did not faile though it was tried to the uttermoſt, this faith carried him through all. When the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple talked of ſtoning him, by this he encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf in the Lord, and was not diſmaied and if it became the Captain of our ſalvation to be made perfect by ſufferings, why ſhould it be thought ſtrange, if all that fight under the ſame banner be made perfect Soulders by the ſame diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Oh that we could all follow him, not only in drinking of the Cup which he drunk off, <hi>viz.</hi> The bitter Cup of the Croſs, but alſo do it with the ſame charity to our enemies as he had, when he prayed, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> whoſe ſteps the <hi>Proto Martyr</hi> St. <hi>Stephen</hi> alſo followed, and for his reward he ſaw the Heavens opened, and his Saviour ſtanding at the right hand of God; by this we are ſure that the ſame Spirit is in us as was in Chriſt. Twas impoſſible for <hi>Job</hi> to have undergone ſo many of Satans fiery darts
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:34461:191"/>upon his eſtate, his relations, and bodily ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but that he believed that his redeemer lived, and that he ſhould ſee him with his eyes at the laſt day, though wormes conſumed his fleſh. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> having fought the good fight of faith, had the like aſſurance as he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, henceforth is layed up for me a Crown of glory, this inabled him to undergo the fight with victory, and this took away the ſting of death, ſo that death it ſelf was not formidable to him; nor to the holy Prophets, Apoſtles and Martyrs, who willingly underwent it for a good conſcience, not accepting deliverance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe great temptations which Satan moſt relieth upon are thoſe of ſins guilt accuſing the conſcience, and bloody perſecutions, though all manner of temptations, as the vanities of the world, the cares of the world, the luſts of the fleſh, the pride of life, are all of them by the arts of our Spiritual adverſary ſo ſuited, and managed, according to ſeveral complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that without this grace they are unreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, therefore the Scripture teſtifieth that this is the victory whereby we overcome the world, and if morality, could be ſufficient to mortify our luſts, and good education as ſome pretend, how came it to paſs that thoſe moral Philoſophers who writ ſo many things againſt luſt, covetouſneſs, and other vices, were yet themſelves overcome of them? but through faith in Chriſt, the world is crucified to us, and we unto the world, that is as well the luſts of the fleſh, the luſts of the eyes, and the pride of life, which containes all that is in the world, all which the faithful ſoul counts but
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:34461:191"/>droſs, and dung for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt Jeſus, whom as the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> ſhe eſteemes fairer than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. And eſteemes ſin the moſt ugly, vile, eformed, and abominable thing in the world, pulling off its mask and vizard whereby it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the men of the world, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Sin deceived me, and thereby ſlew me.</hi> The underſtanding thus inlightened ingageth all it can againſt ſin, as its enemy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by vigilancy it prevailes againſt all aſſaults of temptations, whereby ſin is quite excluded from entring; and ſometimes by flying the occaſions of ſin, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> fled from his Miſtreſs, and by the Spirit aſſiſtance we mortify the fleſh, God and Chriſt ſuſporting. Sometimes by prayer, faith prevailes againſt the tempter, the ſoul fearing its own weakneſs, ſeeks for help of him who is able to ſuccour, and hath ſuccoured it. The laſt refuge which faith hath, is repentance early, and hearty ſorrow for the ſin committed; as <hi>Peter</hi> when he had denied his Lord and Maſter, immediately he went forth and wept bitterly. By theſe means faith quenches all the fiery darts of the wicked. The light of nature teacheth, that the ſoul is borne to more noble things than to wait upon the pleaſure of the ſenſes. But the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life, which the Apoſtle lived when he ſaid, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Shews another inabling principle of life in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate proceeding from that union which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and his members, becauſe Chriſt and they are one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. Therefore he ſaith <hi>(Not I)</hi> becauſe he is not the ſame
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:34461:192"/>man he was before; that man is Crucified with Chriſt and buried with him, he hath derived a new life from Chriſt, as he expreſſeth, <hi>I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured more abundantly than all, yet not I, but Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt is the ſpring of it, the matter of it, and end of it. Conſider the end of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation Jeſus Chriſt, and if Chriſt live in us we ſhall do, think, and ſpeak as he did.</p>
               <p>As all other graces of Gods children are ſometimes weaker than they are at other times, ſo is faith. But th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:34461:192"/>the loſs of Gods holy Spirit, and feels himſelf deprived of the joy of his ſalvation, and this joy when it is reſtored is ſo great, that it will make the broken bones rejoyce; he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the greatneſs of the joy now in the loſs of it, <hi>Pſal. I have roared for the very diſquietneſs of my heart.</hi> God deprives us of it for our ſins, that we may be the more careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and fearful by ſin to looſe it, or hazard it, and to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling; for though Gods lays not upon his children all that they deſerve, yet they ſhall not go unpuniſhed: Judgment ſhall begin at the houſe of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.24.

               <p>Now for as much as the motions &amp; workings of the holy Spirit in the faithful people of God by inlightning them in the underſtanding of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly truths, bringing to mind and applying the word of God to their comfort, inabling them to converſe and walk with God in holy Meditation, contemplation, prayer and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, making melody in their hearts to the Lord, delighting them, and rejoycing them in the want of all things, as the Prophet <hi>Habak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kuk</hi> expreſſeth, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Though the Fig Tree ſhould not bloſſom, nor fruits be in the vines,</hi> &amp;c. And making them to abound with inward joy, when their afflictions do moſt abound, ſlighting and contemning alike both worldly joy, and ſorrow, for the joy which they have in the Lord, theſe are the ſtudy, imployment and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of a regenerate perſon, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:34461:193"/>to be alwaies exerciſed, becauſe he cannot find ſatisfaction, nor delight in any thing elſe; hence he may be more truly, and properly ſaid to live by faith and by the Spirit, than to live the life natural, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues he did, when he ſaith, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, yet I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life which I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who hath loved me, and given himſelf for me.</hi> Therefore they are as it were out of their lives, and void of all injoyment, and comfort, when they want the comforts, and aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, as Holy <hi>David</hi> did greatly reſent the abſence of it, and fear leſt it ſhould be taken from him, and that he ſhould be caſt away, ſo do moſt of Gods people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.14. <hi>Sion</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me;</hi> Though God had graven her in the palms of his hands. When God hides his face, and withdraws himſelf, they are caſt down, as <hi>Pſal. I ſaid in my proſperity I ſhould never be caſt down, but thou hideſt thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> This withdrawing of God was the very bittereſt of our Saviours ſufferings. If this ſhould be our condition, let us not be weary of well doing, but wait on the Lord, for God hath ſaid <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. <hi>That he that waits on the Lord ſhall be like an Eagle.</hi> And conſider that Chriſt Jeſus ſuffered the like, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath a fellow feeling of our ſuffering, that he might ſuccour us who are tempted. But if Chriſt doth not ſuccour us, our heart cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, our hands cannot be ſtrong in the days that God ſhall thus deal with us, as it is <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 14. But he hath bid us to call upon him
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:34461:193"/>in the time of our trouble, and promiſed that he will deliver us.</p>
               <p>But how can they now pray when they want the aſſiſtance of the Spirit? it may be anſwerd. That God ſometimes takes away the comfort of the holy Spirit, and yet the other effects of it remain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15, 16. <hi>Look down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and behold from the habitation of thy holineſs where is thy Zeal, and thy ſtrength, and the ſounding of thy bowels, and of thy mercies towards me? are they reſtrained? Doubtleſs thou art our Father, thou O Lord art our Redeemer,</hi> &amp;c. Some incouragement the Church found for prayer, and if it ſhould be ſo with us that we cannot call God Father, yet the duty of prayer is not to be neglected, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.8. <hi>Though he will not riſe and give him, becauſe he is his friend, yet becauſe of his importunity he will,</hi> &amp;c. Though we think our ſelves unworthy to call God Father, like the prodigal Son which deſired to be but as one of the hired Servants, this humility is the way to obtain our requeſts.</p>
               <p>Another way whereby we may come to him in prayer is, to pray to him as the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus, for Chriſt is not aſhamed to call us his Bretheren, therefore God will not be aſhamed to be our Father. And with fervent prayer let us uſe reading, and meditating in the word of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Give all deligence to make your calling, and elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſure.</hi> Aſſurance differs from ſecurity in this, that Aſſurance fills the ſoul with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the grace of God and his unſpeakable love. Behold what manner of love the Father hath ſhewed us, that we ſhould be called the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:34461:194"/>Sons of God, but ſecurity never urgeth the ſoul to thankfulneſs. Another difference that aſſurance urgeth the ſoul to free obedience but ſecurity not when the ſoul knoweth that what ever her infirmities, failings, and wants are, ſhe ſhall receive of his fulneſs grace for grace.</p>
               <p>When the Spirit beareth witneſs with our Spirit that we are the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>When we have received the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things which are freely given unto us of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>When the Heavenly Bridegroom brings his Spouſe into his Banqueting Houſe, and his banner over her is love, Cant.</hi> 2.4. He treats her with flagons, and comforts her with apples, then ſhe is ſick of love to him, and then is the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when he will give her his loves, his left-hand under her head, and his right hand embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her; and as he chareſſes her, ſo ſhe doth the like to him as lovers vie with one another in love. If ſhe finds him without, ſhe promiſeth to kiſs him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. And to lead him, and bring him into her Mothers houſe, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. She finds him, and holds him, and will not let him go until ſhe brings him into the Chamber of her that conceived her, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.13. She calls him a bundle of myrrh, and layes him all night between her breaſts, namely in her heart by love to him, and ſhe gives him the pledges of her love.</p>
               <p>Thus the ſoul at times doth enjoy her belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then ſhe is ſure of him, and of his love. But he knocks, when ſhe is in bed, and ſhe makes excuſes for not riſing to him, though her bowels were moved for him as ſoone as he
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:34461:194"/>put in his hand at the door, but her love was too ſlow, and did not keep pace with his love, for this unkindneſs he withdraws himſelf when ſhe opens to him; ſhe called him, and he gave her no anſwer, ſhe ſought him, and ſhe could not find him, but while ſhe ſeeks him, ſhe is taken by the Watch ſtripped, ſmitten, and wounded, and her vail taken from her.</p>
               <p>So alſo may a true believer looſe in part the knowledg and ſenſe of his aſſurance which he hath ſometimes enjoyed; though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the faith rooted, and grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſo as they never waver nor fall away, yet they may ſlumber ſo as to be awakened by the motions of the holy Spirit, though poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not ſo ſoon but that he may have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne himſelf, as it is there deſcribed, in thoſe words, <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh.—The voice of my beloved that knocketh—Open unto me my Siſter, my Love, my Dove, my unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet when her beloved hath withdrawn himſelf, he doth leave behind him ſuch a ſweet perfume upon the handles of the locks, as may inflame the well diſpoſed ſoul to ſeek him with ſuch eager, and reſtleſs purſuit, as to retrive her beloved again, and then ſhe will hold him faſt, and will not let him go, until ſhe hath brought him into the Chamber of her that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her; that is, ſhee will go to thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and thoſe opportunities of grace where ſhe firſt taſted the prelibations of glory, the firſt kiſſes of his mouth, and pledges of his love; and when ſhe doth again taſt them, and theſe pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his love are again renewed, and ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:34461:195"/>ſits under his ſhadow with delight. What other thing can I eſteeme this but the injoy ment of Heaven in the firſt fruits; for where Chriſt is, there is Heaven, he makes it ſo; he gives all as is deſirable, here then muſt needs be aſſurance for the poſture of fitting, and the manner of the poſture with delight, both do imply it. As alſo that other expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth imply, <hi>viz.</hi> Her bringing him into the Chambers of her that conceived her. And that alſo, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. his left-hand was under me, and his right-hand embraced me, for if ſhe be in the armes of Jeſus her Saviour, ſhe can not be ſafer, no not in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And faith thus acted, and acting, liveth in and by her beloved, and breaks out into theſe and like expreſſions with the heavenly ſpouſe in the <hi>Canticles. And makes her boaſt of God all the day. And by him is able to do mighty acts and to ſuffer any thing for the love of him.</hi>

               <p>Thoſe ſweet compellations which almighty God uſeth to his poor creature man, if they do but ſink into our hearts, they muſt needs make ſuch impreſſions as will cauſe reciprocal love to him. <hi>Is Ephraim a dear Son? is he a pleaſent Child?</hi> what can endear thee more than this, Oh my ſoul? what love canſt thou deſire more? he counts thee, and calls thee in this Relation, Son, looks upon thee with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion as his child, and pittieth thee as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pittieth his Child, delighteth in thee as a Father delighteth in a Child whom he loveth and helpeth thee as his Child. <hi>Behold what manner of love God hath ſhewed thee, that thou ſhouldeſt be called the Son of God, Joh.</hi> 1.4. If a Son, then an heir, and joynt heir with
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:34461:196"/>Chriſt his only begotten Son, for Chriſt is not aſhamed to call us Bretheren, in this relation to God, and Chriſt, what canſt thou want or fear, or what more canſt thou deſire? in the <hi>3d.

               <p>WOrthy of our meditation are all the workes of God, and every word of his to be ſtudied by us, that we may thereby improve our graces, but his workes of mercy, and that part of his word which holdeth forth mercy, and offers it, and ſets forth God in the Glory, and excellency of his mercy, is moſt neceſſary for ſinful man, and moſt comfortable to be conſidered. All that are ſaved, are ſaved by meditating of this; all that are loſt, are loſt, and periſh for lack of the knowledg of this this is life eternal to know thee, the only true God and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The freeneſs then, and largeneſs of it, is to be our chief ſtudy; free it is. What motive found he in us to move him, when enemies, to give his Son up for us all, and to beſeech us, but only from his own goodneſs, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in mercy.</p>
               <p>The man that ſeeks his loſt ſheep may get

               <p>The largeneſs of his mercy is without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, for if he hath commanded us to forgive ſeventy times ſeven times, will not he frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgive us what we are not able to ſatisfy, ſince he makes his forgiving of us many tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, the argument why we ſhould forgive petty debts: can we imaging that he will take the firſt forfeiture, ſince he hath commanded us not only to forgive our enemies, but to love them, bleſs them, pray for them, to do good for evil, will not he forgive us, love us, and bleſs us as freely for Chriſts ſake, though there be no motive in us for it? would he make love to be the fulfilling of the law? charity the covering of tranſgreſſion? prefer charity before piety, by commanding us to leave our gift at the Altar, to be reconciled to our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, prefer it before faith, and all gifts, and graces, making it as it were, the ligament and ſinews of all, and that if we want that, all other graces are but empty ſounds, make a noiſe in the ear, without any profit? would God require ſuch love from us, but that he is Love, Gracious, Merciful, and full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, ſlow to anger, hateth nothing that he hath made; what can he ſay more free to thee, though thou art as an adulterous Spouſe to him, yet thou maieſt returne, and he will receive thee again, though thou bringeſt no merit, but demerit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:34461:198"/>He hath excluded none from his mercy unleſs they be ſuch as will ſhew no mercy, or elſe thoſe that ſin of malicious wickedneſs, and ſin in deſpight of the Spirit wilfully againſt light. The entail of his mercy is to thouſands of them that love him.</p>

Thus let the word and the Sacraments convey him to us.</p>
                  <p>Since thou hateſt nothing that thou haſt made, and thy delight is among the Sons of men
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:34461:199"/>(<hi>Pro.</hi> 1.) <hi>Certainly thou doſt not afflict nor grieve willingly the Sons of men. Therefore when we cry unto the Lord in our trouble he delivers us out of diſtreſs, Pſal.</hi> 104. He cannot forbear to kiſs, and embrace his prodigal Son.</p>
                  <p>O let thy revelation of thy love to man recall mans ſtraying affections to God. If we believe this our faith will work love to him again, and we ſhall be as willing to be reconciled to him, as he to be reconciled to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. If while we were enemies Chriſt died for us, whom hath he not died for? who is excluded from his mercy? much more being juſtified by his blood will he ſave us, ſeeing he hath done ſo much for us when we were worſe: now that we are put in a better relation by the blood of Chriſt, and are reconciled to him, and made juſt perſons, much more now will he do the reſt, which is but the conſequence of the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to ſave us. All this is free mercy. Not of workes which we have done, but of his own good will he begot us, and accordingly we are juſtified freely by his grace.</p>

                  <p>I find no condition annexed to be precedent to make a ſubject capable of mercy, but only want, and deſire of mercy; want I have without my own act or endeavour, deſire of relief too ariſeth ſpontaneouſly without my endeavour, and largeneſs of deſire proceeds from a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous mind, an eye unſatisfied, yet ſuch is the ocean of mercy that it requires but only that we open our mouth wide, and he will fill it, as he promiſeth. As long as the widow brought empty veſſels, the Oyl ran; he giveth liberally
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:34461:200"/>and upbraideth not; he giveth more then we are able to ask, or think, the debtor doth but deſire forbearance, but the Lord forgives him the debt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jacob</hi> only deſired food, and raiment, and God increaſed him to two bands. <hi>Abraham</hi> deſired but a Son, and God increaſeth his ſeed as the ſand of the Sea. The prodigal deſires to be but as a Servant, and the Father entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him with embracings and feaſtings. But as for his people that truſt in him, mercy imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them on every ſide. God ſatisfieth their mouth with good things, they ſhall want no manner of thing that is good. He will fulfil the deſire of them that fear him; if he doth not give the thing deſired, he will take away the deſire of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.4. <hi>Delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and he will give the thy hearts deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſtarve our ſouls for want of asking. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh</hi> ſtruck three times on the ground and the Prophet was angry and ſaid to him <hi>Thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have ſtrucken ſix or ſeven times. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſaith, <hi>you are not ſtraitned in us, but in your own bowels.</hi> And tis ſaid of Chriſt, that he could not do many works, becauſe of their infidelety, to be often upon our knees ſhews our faith in him, believing his goodneſs and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly care of us. Infidelity doth as it were bind the hands of God, who is not wanting in his bowels of mercy.</p>
                  <p>Be ſenſible then (O my ſoul) of thy wants, know where to go for thy ſupply, namely, to him that inviteth thee; give way to thy moſt inlarged deſires, when thou goeſt to an infinite ſupply, be not ſtraitned in thine own bowels, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen thy mouth wide, come boldly as he biddeth
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:34461:200"/>thee. And ask the things that are pleaſing in his ſight, ſince thou knoweſt thou ſhalt receive them, if they be ſuch things as the word of God teaches thee to ask; fear not, becauſe thou art ſenſible of thine own unworthineſs, ſince ſuch are invited, and the beſt are unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Servants. And when they have done all, they may and muſt acknowledge themſelves ſuch; and, ſtand in need of the merits of their Saviour, and are juſtified freely by grace, if ſo, much more muſt ſuch ſinners as I, and ſuch as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> ſee our own unprofitableneſs. But Oh that I could love as much as ſhe did, becauſe much is forgiven me, and I believe that he will forgive me, becauſe he hath given me many things, and it is eaſier, and leſſer in the eſteem of men, to forgive a debt than to give.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall undoubtedly believe his love to me, If I can feel in my heart ſuch love to him.</p>

                  <p>When I find the Lord reckoning up the grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſins of his auncient people the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they were a rebellious people, lying Children that would not hearken to the law of the Lord, which ſay to the ſeers, ſee not, and to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, propheſy not unto us right things, but deceits, cauſe the holy one of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ceaſe from before us, for which iniquity he threatens them, <hi>v.</hi> 13. And <hi>v.</hi> 15. Promiſeth them ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation if they return, but finding them obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate they would not, whereby they procure their own ruin. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15.18. He will wait to be gracious unto them. He will be exalted that he may ſhew mercy unto them, as if he had ſaid, though their ſins were never
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:34461:201"/>ſo great, yet his mercy ſhould not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, his mercy is infinite as he is; their ſins are the ſins of men, his mercies the mercies of God, that where iniquity doth abound, grace doth ſuperabound; his mercy is free without any merit in us, or any motive, unleſs it be our miſery, the motive of his patience, and mercy is only from himſelf, but that he waited to be gracious implies that though his mercy were never ſo free, yet he could not find a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſhew it then when they were ſo averſe from him.</p>
                  <p>Since then the motive of mercy is only in God himſelf, we may infer that there is nothing in him to diſcourage faith, and recumbency upon him; ſo that although we have been guilty of ſuch ſins as theſe are, or the ſame, though we have been rebellious, lying, averſe, and would not hearken unto his voice, nor to his Prophets, and have hindred them from ſpeaking right things, yet let us remember our ſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unto him as the <hi>Ninevites</hi> did when they were warned, who knowes but he may wait to be gracious to us alſo, but let us not preſume upon his mercy, and make that which ſhould be our Phyſick, our Poiſon.</p>
                  <p>We know that he hath given us a High Prieſt, who doth not only know our inſirmities, and impotencies, but therefore knew them that he might have compaſſion upon us. Bleſſed Jeſus thou knoweſt that no man can come after thee, unleſs the Father draw him, help thou our weak nature by thy Holy Spirits aſſiſtance, draw us, we will run after thee.

                  <p>If our forgiving the treſpaſſes of others be the pattern of Gods forgiveneſs to us, how
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:34461:202"/>few can be ſaved, for none ever forgave every injury that hath been done to him, ſome they have revenged. But if God doth not pardon every ſin to us, we are damned. Lord give us thy grace to be as free in the pardoning of all treſpaſſes without exception, though never ſo many as we would have thee forgive us, for we cannot have ſo many committed againſt us, as we have committed againſt thee, therefore we have need of a larger pardon from God to us than we can have occaſion to give others.</p>
                  <p>If God would take accompt of us, we ſhall have need of forgiveneſs for a thouſand talents, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.24. More than we are able to ſatisfy; yet when we fall down before him, beſeeching his pardon, he freely forgives us all. But if we for a hundred pence or leſs, which our fellow Servant oweth us, and is not able to pay, will not forbear him till he is able, but uſe all violence againſt him, we ſhall make our ſelves unworthy and uncapable of the mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the moſt juſt God; and leaſt we ſhould ſeem to curſe our ſelves, we rather pray, <gap reason="foreign">

We aſſert our own mercy, and compaſſion to our debtors, as if our clemency, and kindneſs to others did oblige God to the like: ſo the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion deſired Chriſt Jeſus but to ſpeak the word, as he himſelf uſed to do in his authority.</p>
                  <p>Lord, ſince thou haſt given us a law to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our enemies, to bleſs them that curſe us, to pray for them that diſpitefully uſe us; wilt thou not obſerve it thy ſelf, and forgive us all our treſpaſſes; certainly thou wilt freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:34461:202"/>give us; forgive us the rather, becauſe thou knoweſt that we have nothing to pay; forgive us firſt, becauſe thou art the fountain of all goodneſs, and if we have any goodneſs, it comes from this fountain, and unleſs thou giveſt the grace of love and compaſſion by firſt obliging us by thy pardoning mercy and compaſſion, whereof thou haſt declared thy ſelf to be full; how ſhould we learn compaſſion to others? how canſt thou require ſuch goodneſs from poor, weak, miſerable men, unleſs thou who art good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love wilt do the like to us, in pardoning and forgiving our treſpaſſes? aſſure us therefore that thou haſt pardoned us all our ſins, and blotted out all our iniquities for thy name ſake, and that the blood of Chriſt hath cleanſed us from all our ſins, and then we ſhall be without excuſe if we from our hearts forgive not every man his treſpaſſes.
